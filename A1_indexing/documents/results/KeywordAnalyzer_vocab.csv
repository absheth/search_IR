There were no immediate indications that Colombia's drug cartelswere involved in the killings, the latest to convulse this countrysince the government ordered a crackdown on traffickers inmid-August.   Authorities said they did not know who carried out an attack inwhich six people riding in a truck were killed by gunmen in anambush. In a separate incident, a bomb killed six other people,police said.   Late Tuesday, Oky Botero, a bullfighter who raised bulls and wasa private pilot, was shot to death in an upper-class Medellin suburbwhile driving a Jeep, police said. He was riddled with bullets froma passing car, the authorities said.   At about the same time in Santador de Quilichao, a town about 210miles southwest of Bogota, assailants broke into the house of localcouncil president Ruben Dario Fernandez and shot him to death. DarioFernandez was local head of the Marxist opposition Union PatrioticaParty.   Officials gave these accounts of the other attacks:   A group of men attacked a coffee plantation near Quinchia, a town120 miles north of Bogota, early Tuesday and a bomb was thrown intothe owner's house.   Quinchia Mayor Saul Botero told the RCN radio network that sixpeople were killed and five, including ranch owner Antonio Zuluaga,were wounded. He said Zuluaga's wife, the couple's two daughters,two nephews and a ranch worker were killed.   Botero reported Zuluaga said guerrillas of the Popular LiberationArmy had demanded money and when he refused the extortionersthreatened to kill him and his family.   Police said they have not determined the motive for the ambush ona rural road near San Luis de Gaceno, a town 90 miles east ofBogota. They said all six people aboard a truck were killed by menwho stopped the vehicle, opened fire and then escaped.   It was not known if that attack might be related to a strike by22,000 banana plantation workers in northern Colombia where bothleftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads are active. Thestrike spread to 11 other districts Tuesday.   The strike affecting plantations along Colombia's Caribbean coastcould cause a shortage of bananas in the United States.   Companies exporting bananas to the United States have said theywere losing $1 million a day because of the strike that began Nov. l.   The strike originally started to protest the killings last monthof two union leaders. Union members blamed right-wing death squadsfor the killings.   Now the strikers are demanding higher pay, shorters hours andmedical care. The average pay for a plantation worker is theequivalent of $79 per month for six-day work weeks of 10 hours a day.   The president of the Association of Banana Companies, Jose ManuelArias, claimed the strikes were organized by leftist guerrillas andwere a ``festival of terrorism.''   He said in an interview published Tuesday by the Bogota daily ElTiempo that the strikes were organized by the ColombianRevolutionary Armed Forces and the People's Liberation Army, two ofColombia's six left-wing guerrilla groups.   The strike is centered in Apartado, a town of 100,000 and thecapital of the region.   Gen. Jose Hernan Guzman, army commander of the region, told ElTiempo he feared there would be violence because of the strike.   He said he had tried to get the companies and workers to reach anagreement that ``has no winners and no losers.''   The worst attack in the zone blamed on rightist death squadsoccurred about a year ago, on Nov. 11, when men firing from carskilled 43 people in Segovia, a town 150 miles southeast of Apartado.

'Tis the season to be traditional, but sillySantas, laughing reindeer and teddy bears are arriving in mailboxesnationwide this year as Christmas card makers appeal to a trend incard buying that transcends race, religion and sex _ humor.   Those who like the offbeat can send a card showing cow udderssinging a Christmas carol or Santa kicking a football through theantlers of a laughing reindeer.   While the majority of the 2.3 billion Christmas cards sent thisyear will reflect more customary symbols of the holiday, humor iswhere the growth is, said Terry Carney, spokeswoman for AmericanGreetings Corp., the largest publicly owned greeting card companywith $1.2 billion in annual sales.   ``But it's not usually the kind of humor that is nasty, rude orsarcastic,'' said Ms. Carney.   About 500 members of the creative staff at American, based insuburban Cleveland, produce about 2,300 designs a year of whichabout one-third are Christmas cards, Ms. Carney said.   In addition to laughs, specialty cards with a regional flavor _cactus for the Southwest, for instance _ or messages aimed atparticular occupations are popular.   As with most consumer tastes, the explanation is demographic.   ``The bulk of the cards purchased are by people between 35 and59,'' said E. Gray Glass III, a New York stock market analyst withPrudential-Bache Inc. Glass. ``These are people that move around alot and they want to keep in contact with their friends.''   Barbara Miller, spokeswoman for Hallmark Cards Inc., agreed thathumor is in this year, but she said tradition dies hard.   ``Wreaths, holly trees, bells, fireplace and sleigh scenes _these are the symbols people see as Christmas,'' she said.   That doesn't mean the giant Hallmark hasn't cultivated a Yuppiesense of humor. One Hallmark offering shows a dazed cat with astocking cap swinging on an ornament attached to Christmas treelights. Inside, the caption reads, ``In the air there's a feline ofChristmas.''   Among the specialty cards designed to suit distinctive tastesare ones ``for the barber, the teacher, bus driver or themailman,'' Ms. Miller said.   With annual sales of more than $3.5 billion, the privately heldHallmark, based in Kansas City, Mo., has the biggest single shareof the greeting card market, producing 2,700 card designs forover-the-counter sales and another 400 different boxed sets ofmultiple cards, Ms. Miller said.   Glass said Hallmark produces about 44 percent of U.S. Christmascards, followed by American with 32 percent and Cincinnati-basedGibson Greetings Inc. about 10 percent.   Another 700 to 800 U.S. companies produce the remainder of U.S.Christmas cards with a negligible portion coming from foreignmanufacturers, Glass said.   Among the strangest, if not funniest, cards to emerge arepet-to-pet missives.   ``From our cat to your cat, from our dog to your dog _ peopleconsider their pets part of the family,'' Ms. Miller said. ``Theyare cute cards, not drippy or sentimental.''

'Twill be a grand St. Patrick's Day after all for millions ofCatholics who faced the disheartening possibility of eating theircabbage and potatoes straight up.   Some fellas named O'Connor and Quinn and a few of their pals havedecided to make a wee bit of an exception March 17 to the ruleforbidding Roman Catholics from eating meat on Fridays during Lent.   The ``special dispensations'' granted by bishops in Irishenclaves throughout the country in recent days will permit many ofthe nation's 53 million Catholics to have their corned beef and eatit, too.   ``We're very grateful that (they) understand that fish doesn'thave any place in a good Irish stew,'' said Dorothy Cudahy, who willbe grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York City.   Up until the 1960s, the Catholic Church banned meat on allFridays. It was a penitential practice in commemoration of the deathof Jesus Christ on a Friday ``and also in expressing sorrow forone's sin,'' said the Rev. Michael Walsh, head of the Office ofPastoral Research and Practices for the U.S. Catholic Conference.   The rules changed in 1966 when Pope Paul VI issued a papaldocument allowing church leaders in each country to establish theirown rules on doing penance.   In the United States, bishops decided to encourage Catholics todo other forms of penance most of the year, but kept the Friday banon meat during Lent, which runs from Ash Wednesday to Easter.   ``The basic principle is that it is good for the soul to do somesort of penitential practice,'' said Bill Ryan, deputy director ofthe Office of Media Relations for the Catholic conference.   But individual bishops still hold the right to grant specialdispensations, and that's just what many did after they realized St.Patrick's Day falls on a Friday this year.   They include Cardinal John O'Connor of New York; Archbishop JohnQuinn of San Francisco; Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston; and theircounterparts in Chicago; Cincinnati; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Newark, N.J.   The prelates have asked those who eat meat on St. Patrick's Dayto observe another day of abstinence or do some other additional actof penance.   Individual Catholics always remain free not to follow the fastingregulations for ``just and serious cause,'' Walsh said, but thebishops' action ``kind of eases everybody's conscience.''   ``We have an old expression in the Latin _ Ecclesia est benignamater: The church is a kind mother,'' said Monsignor WilliamStanton, pastor of a church in predominantly Irish South Buffalo.``Her children are feasting, and why not?''   One observer in San Francisco said Quinn was just a step ahead ofhis flock with the dispensation.   ``Sure, sure, sure, they'll all be eating corned beef, especiallyin the places where it's free,'' said John Whooley, publisher of theIrish Herald newspaper. ``The archbishop was wise to do that becausethey'll all be eating it anyway.''   A Cincinnati restaurant owner said there's only one item theycould have banned that would affect affect her business on March 17.   ``Most people, as long as they can get green beer _ that's allthey care about,'' said Helen Russum, co-owner of the Crow's Nest onthe city's west side.   Not everyone agreed with dropping the ban on meat.   The Rev. Daniel Hurley, a campus minister at St. BonaventureUniversity in western New York, said he would prefer the church keepthe centuries-old ban as a sign of reverence _ but he is not goingto be ``holier-than-thou'' about the whole thing.   ``If it were my decision, I'd probably stick with it throughoutLent,'' Hurley said. ``Since it isn't, I'll probably take advantageof it.''	(At the Communist Party's 10th Plenum, during which it wasdecided to restore legal status to Solidarity) I really threweverything onto the scale, my destiny and my dignity ... It would bethe greatest drama for me if history one day said these decisionswere wrong. That's why I wish so much that the agreement, that thispluralism, passes the test in real life.   It is a great opportunity. One can add that the situation hasnever been this favorable for us, for improving East-West relationswith Poland as a bridge. I am not saying this out of a Polishmegalomania, but ours is a nation of nearly 40 million people in thecenter of Europe, which is on one hand strongly rooted in the Eastpolitically and economically, but on the other hand very stronglyrooted in the West, traditionally and culturally. And of coursethere are millions (of people of Polish descent living outsidePoland), which is also important ... .   We also have a very good situation in that there is perestroikaand that our Polish experiment is in a sense in the avant-garde ofthese reforms. It gives us a strong position within this system andgives us a full feeling of independence and sovereignty in solvingour problems.   (It remains to be seen) to what extent we are successful ... inimplementing difficult economic reforms which require a degree ofpublic acceptance and support, because these reforms are painful ...like every surgery that is expected to bring health. When there areonly anesthetics, after some time the illness returns even morestrongly. When it's only a bandage placed on a sore, then of coursethe results are only partial, like we have had so far.	(Bush): Monsieur.   Q: President Mitterrand, I'd like to ask you if you discussed inany way China, and what you think of President Bush's decision tosend his envoys to China recently? And if I could follow on that,Mr. Bush, if perhaps you've had second thoughts about the nature inwhich this was done,in the secretive fashion, and in the toastingof the Chinese while your envoys were there?   MITTERRAND: Thank you for this question. Well, I should havesaid in my presentation, indeed we did talk about China, and thiswas at the initiative of President Bush, who himself expressed thewish of being able to give us his views on this subject and thereason for what was done. So, I think now you might hear this.   BUSH: I have no second thoughts at all. And being somewhatfamiliar with China, I've learned that you listen to everythingthat's said in a toast. We've looked at every word and analyzed it,and I'm strongly supportive of this mission by General Scowcroftand Larry Eagleburger. I've said that I initiated it and I'm notgoing to go further, except to say that I hope that it will havepositive results.   And we've already seen an indication _ a couple of indicationsof that, but I think, knowing China, again, I think time isrequired. But _ this is a billion plus people, and I do not want tohurt the billion plus people further. And I think we've made theright step and only time will tell how this leadership in Chinaviews the mission.      Q: Is there any agreement between France and the U.S. to slowdown Mr. Kohl in his drive toward reunification? (Laughter.)   MITTERRAND: I have your answer. Is there an agreement orconformity of view to slow down?   Yes, there's a great conformity of views _ particilarly to slowdown the _ as to _ considering slowing down Mr. Kohl, that's aspecific matter.   But we think that everything as was said in Strasbourg is to bedone in the respect of treaties and the principles of Helsinki.   And that at present there are two states. And if the evolutionseems to strengthen and hasten, it would be a good thing for theGerman authority to contribute at the same time, to give up theconstruction which is indispensable for the new European politicalorder, community, etc.   Chancellor Kohl was telling me this yesterday as we weretogether in Switzerland and he says it constantly; and there is noreason to doubt this.   That I did not set any timetable to the aspiration which is thatof all Germans and particular mind towards reunification. ThereforeI am not precipitating events even though I do hope for this. Thisis what Mr. Kohl said.   In any case, he is to conform with the treaties and agreementswhich preside today to the European balance. And therefore I don'thave any particular complaints. Chancellor Kohl is _ Germany _ he'sa German patriot and he obviously has reflections which are notmine.   But the main thing, when we are together and when we speak asresponsible for our own countries, we sketch an outline which wecan agree, and in any case, I shall be meeting with Chancellor Kohlon the fourth of January. And next, he shall be coming to see me inFrance.   Yes, sir?      Q: Mr. Bush about China, do you believe that other countriesthat follow the United States' lead on sanctions should now relievethose sanctions to lighten them? And how would you feel if they didthat against your wishes?   BUSH: I think each country has got to make its owndetermination, but I think basically, if I had to answer yes or no,I'd say _ I'd say no. I think they've got to wait and see howmatters evolve. That's what we're doing, and I think it's prudent.   And for those who suggested that I have normalized relationswith this power because of one visit, they simply are wrong _ offthe reservation on that. So I think that's a matter for othercountries to determine.

(Editors: A version of this story previously appeared on thewire.)   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) _ What makes a successful entrepreneur? Arecent Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey reports thatmany are immigrants, the offspring of self-employed parents, andhold advanced degrees.   The survey of 99 graduates recently honored by the universitygives some insight into people who give up the security of salariesand take risks to start their own businesses.   The honored graduates include sociology consultants, financialmanagers and computer technicians, singled out for their ``hardwork, foresight and courage.''   Collectively, they have created 100,000 jobs in Massachusettsand 250,000 worldwide in fields that range from women's apparel togeotechnical engineering. The cumulative sales of their companiestotal $25 billion annually.   According to the survey, 73 percent earned a degree above thebachelor level, and 33 percent went on to doctoral or post-doctoralwork.   Sixteen percent started their companies while they were still atschool, 34 percent set up shop within five years of graduating, and23 percent opened for business between six and 10 years aftergraduation. Two percent began their companies more than 20 yearsafter graduation.   The survey said more than half were children of parents whofounded their own companies.   Many companies had inauspicious beginnings in basements or roughneighborhoods with minimal staff and equipment. But some of theentrepreneurs had more colorful starts.   Clark Abt, founder of the social sciences consulting firm, AbtAssociates, built ship models and sold them to Saks Fifth Avenuewhen he was only 12. Harold ``Doc'' Edgerton, whom the institutecalled ``the father of flash photography,'' attempted to market hisfirst strobe equipment through General Electric Co., but GE wasn'tinterested.   The most important lessons they learned at MIT, theentrepreneurs said, were problem solving, the importance of hardwork, confidence and the belief that anything is possible.   The entrepreneurs recommended that aspiring business ownersbegin by identifying a market opportunity and matching it with anappropriate technology. They advised selecting partners withtalents that complement their own, pointing out that the success ofthe enterprise depends on employee performance.

They're alsovery French _ a very interesting thing that's called the map oflove _ well, to you journalists _ well just _ the map of love inFrench is up to you to decipher this map. It's not mine. But, whatI do certainly hope is that we keep very close friendship with theUnited States of America as we shall have with the United Kingdom..   Q: (Would you have) given that answer before January 20th, 1989?   MITTERRAND: Before the 20th of January? What happened on the20th of January? (Laughter) You seem to remember my own feelingsmore than I do myself. I would have said _ even before Mr. Bush'selection, is that what you mean? I mean from what I am able todeduce? Because you need a triple translation to get to yourmeaning. I got a long very well with Mr. Reagan, and now that he'sno longer President of the United States of America, and I wouldwant to say anything that might seem slight or restrictive, that'sthe way history was, and now with Mr. Bush we are working together,and I think in a very good, close understanding. But to say more onwhat you're interested in, sir, that is _ well _ just kind ofsentimental press. I'm certainly not going to say any more.   Yes, sir.   Q: President Bush, General Noriega of Panama, who has long beena thorn in the side of the United States, has just this weekdeclared war on the United States. How do you respond to this lastoutrage of General Noriega?   BUSH: Well, I don't respond to it. I notice that he was madesupreme leader, or something of that nature. It has not changed ourview of him at all. He is a narcotics _ an indicted narcoticsdealer. And he ought to get out. And the minute he got out, therelations between Panama and the United States would improvedramatically.   And not only is he a narcotics _ indicted narcotics dealer, buthe singlehandedly aborted the free will of the Panamian people _the will being expressed in open and free elections. And Mr.Noriega singlehandedly sent out his dignity battalions to beat upthe elected vice president and to keep the will of the people frombeing fulfilled. And that is unacceptable as we see the world _particularly in these times when we see the world moving more andmore towards democratic change.	(North resumes his testimony after a lunch break.)

NORTH: This appears to be a copy of a card with the front andback written on it, yes, sir.   SULLIVAN: All right. Would you read that to the jury, please.This is from Vice President Bush in November 1985.   NORTH: It says, ``en route to Andrew's 11-29-85. Dear Ollie, asI head off to Maine for Thanksgiving, I just want to wish you ahappy one with the hope that you get some well deserved rest. Onewith the hope that you get some well deserved rest. One of the manythings I have to be thankful for is the way ... in which you haveperformed under fire in tough situations.   ``Your dedication and tireless work with the hostage thing andwith Central America really gives me cause for great pride in you,and thanks. Get some turkey. George Bush.''   SULLIVAN: That was received in November 1985 ... correct?   NORTH: Yes, sir.   SULLIVAN: Now ... would you explain to the jury, please, how itis that you got involved in your office with trying to rescuehostages?   NORTH: The hostage problem was part of the overall program ofcombating terrorism that the administration had, and it was a veryimportant element of it because we had an increasing number ofhostages being held. ... A consultant who was working for the NSC,Mr. Ledeen ... had brought back from Israel information that theythought that they could achieve an opening to Iran, to moderateelements within the Iranian government, that there was greatpolarization, great disarray in Iran, that the Israelis were fairlysure of their information and had an agent working for them thatcould put us in touch with them. And it involved the exchange ofcertain Israeli weapons to Iran which could result in the releaseof both Israeli hostages in Lebanon and the American hostages inLebanon.   SULLIVAN: Colonel, would you explain why you are dealing withthe country of Iran if the hostages were in Lebanon?   NORTH: Within Lebanon, there were several groups of Shiafundamentalists, Moslem fundamentalists who had political loyaltyto the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. ... and so the Israelis, and weagreed, though that if you could influence some of the moremoderate elements in Iran to cut them off financially, or toconvince them to turn loose the American hostages and the Jewishhostages that were being held, along with some other europeans likethe French and Italians and British ...   SULLIVAN: Were there missiles sent to Iran and did a hostagecome out as a result?   NORTH: Yes, it did. (The hostage was Rev. Benjamin Weir) ...Itook, at the direction of the president, a letter from thepresident to meet Mr. Weir, Reverend Weir; met with him; had a CIAairplane take me to the meeting, in an effort to assure ReverendWeir that his cooperation was necessary for us to be able to helprescue the other _ or recover the other hostages.   (North describes how he continued meeting with Israeliintermediaries in an attempt to open up discussions with moderatesin Iran in an attempt to gain the release of U.S. hostages beingheld in Lebanon.)   NORTH: I went and talked to Mr. McFarlane about this in terms ofhow far we were going on this initiative and what role we were toplay. And he told me simply that we were going to allow theIsraelis to proceed with this, that it was their initiative andthat we were to simply position the necessary people in the rightplaces to be able to safely recover the hostages and be preparedfor a high level meeting with the Iranians.   SULLIVAN: Colonel, let's focus on the dates ... a little bithere. September, '85, TOW missiles are shipped, is that correct?   NORTH: I believe so, yes, sir. ...   SULLIVAN: You were not involved in the earliest stages of that,correct?   NORTH: No, but at one point I did ask Mr. McFarlane if thepresident approved it and he told me he had.   (North describes a shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran through theIsraelis to get the hostages freed.)   SULLIVAN: Were the transportation and logistical problems (withthe shipment) eventually worked out?   NORTH: Yes, they were from purely the transportation problem.But they weren't worked out as far as the Iranians were concerned.... (the missiles) were eventually shipped and they did arrive in acity in Iran, not Tehran, but another city, and it wasn't the full80 that they had asked for. It was only 18, I believe.   SULLIVAN: And was it anticipated that hostages would be releasedas a result of this November, '85 Hawk shipment?   NORTH: Yes, and we had gone to some lengths to position theappropriate people to receive them. ... we had no operational rolein this other than to recover the hostages when they were released.We weren't planning any of this. We were kind of responding to it.   SULLIVAN: Now, Colonel, focusing your attention after the Hawkshipment could you describe to the jury what problem arose afterthe Hawks arrived in Iran? Did a hostage get out as anticipated?   NORTH: On the November shipment, no. Apparently what theIranians had been told by the Israeli agent was something differentthan what they expected. And they were to put it mildly very angryover what was delivered in that November shipment. The Novembershipment was 18 Hawk missiles and they had apparently expectedsomething entirely different. ... the Iranians ... came back to theIsraelis very, very upset about what had transpired and they saidthat they'd been cheated and that therefore nobody was going to bereleased, no Israelis, no Americans, no Europeans, nobody.

When vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication, harshpersonal attacks upon one another's motives and one another'scharacter drown out the quiet logic of serious debate on importantissues, things that we ought to be involved ourselves in, surelythat is unworthy of our institution, unworthy of our Americanpolitical process.

In a report to Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the energy departmentsaid the work to be done includes cleaning up soil, surface andground water, including removal, treatment and disposal of bulkwastes.   Glenn, at a news conference, urged the Reagan and Bushadministrations to commit significant resources to the job.   Chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Committee, Glenn saidthe situation at 17 nuclear facilities is so serious it represents``nothing less than an environmental time bomb.''   ``It's up to the White House to ask for enough money to defusethat bomb before it explodes,'' Glenn said. ``The acid test of ourgovernment's commitment to cleaning up these facilities does not liein this report, but in the amount of money that is actually budgetedand spent for cleanup.   ``Campaign rhetoric, promises and good intentions will not do thejob,'' he said. ``We've waited too long already to start this job.We simply cannot afford to wait any longer.''   Glenn said his committee will open hearings early in the year toexamine the energy department report and two others soon to beissued.   They include a follow-up report on the cost of clean up at eachspecific nuclear site and the so-called ``2010 study'' which is toexamine goals for nuclear weapons production and facilities in theyear 2010.   Glenn said the latter reports should be issued over the next fewweeks.   Glenn said he is concerned that insufficient funds for thecleanup job will be included in the budget being prepared by theOffice of Management and Budget and added: ``The main thing is, willthey have guts enough to put this in the new budget?''   He said that he understands that OMB is considering proposingspending of about $1.4 billion for the fiscal year beginning nextOct. 1 but asserted that it will take at least $1.8 billion ``tojust keep up.''   ``As far as I'm concerned, $1.4 billion is completelyinadequate,'' he said.   Glenn said that while spending in the magnitude of some $6billion a year is clearly called for, he believes a good start canbe made with a cleanup program costing $3.5 billion to $4 billion ayear.   ``It's not going to get any cheaper,'' Glenn said. ``We know ithas to be done. Let's get on with it.''	,   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Department of Energy says it may take $91billion to $200 billion over 60 years to clean up radioactive andchemical contamination at 45 government civilian and militarynuclear plants.

(AP) _ A complete guide to state fishing records isnow available from an Athens publisher.   ``Henderson's Guide to Freshwater &amp; Saltwater State Game FishRecords,'' published by Outdoor Statistical Resources, lists staterecords for freshwater fish from all 50 states and saltwaterrecords from all coastal states except Hawaii, Maine and Oregon,which keep no such records.   Rankings are listed for each state by species of fish. The bookalso indicates which state records are world records. --_   One easy way to mess up a fishing trip is to get a hook caughtin an arm, leg or other part of your anatomy.   There's a relatively simple way to get the hook out without atrip to the doctor _ all you need is some ice, a bit of relativelystrong fishing line and some antiseptic.   It will hurt _ but not that badly _ and with after a quick patchjob, you'll be ready to continue fishing.   Here's how to do it, according to the people at Mercury Marine.   If the hook is attached to a lure, remove the lure. Then packsome ice over the wound to both numb the area and reduce bleeding.   Tie a loop in the fish line and place the loop around the backof your wrist. Run the loop out to your hand between the thumb andforefinger.   Put the other end of the loop over the hook and snug it againstthe inside bend. Then use your thumb to apply pressure on the eyeof the hook, down against the skin.   The pressure both steadies the hook and aligns the barb with theentry hole. Pushing down on the eye also spreads the wound open andthe barb will come out without tearing as much skin.   While keeping pressure on the hook, give the line a quick jerk.The hook should pop out.   Then rinse the cut in clean water, apply antiseptic and abandage, then go back after the big one. --_   Your casting will be in trouble if you put the line on your reelpoorly. The line could twist and tangle.   The American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers Association suggeststhe following steps to fill a reel.   Revolving spool, or level-wind, reels:   Insert a pencil or short stick through the hole in the supplyspool. Have another person hold both ends of the stick and keep alittle pressure on the spool.   The line should come off the top of the supply spool and in overthe top of the reel. Fill to within one-eighth inch of the lip onthe reel.   Spinning reels:   Attach the reel to a rod and string the line from the supplyspool down through the guides. Open the bail and tie the line tothe spool. Then flip the bail closed.   Have another person hold the rim of the supply spool so it willspiral off the supply spool in the same coil direction as you wantit to go onto the reel spool.   This prevents line twist as you wind on the line.   Holding the rod tip several feet from the supply spool, tensethe line between the thumb and forefinger of your rod-holding hand.Wind on several turns of line. If the line is coming from thecorrect side of the supply spool, it will spiral off in open, loosecoils.   If not, it soon will begin to twist. If this occurs, turn thesupply spool around. Fill the reel to slightly below the spool lip.   Closed-faced spincast reels:   Use the same methods as for open-face reels, except remove thenosecone and hold it slightly in front of the reel while winding onthe line. That way you can see when the spool is filled to theproper level, slightly before the spool lip.   Be sure to properly dispose of your old line. If you throw itinto the water, it can kill fish or other marine life. --_   Hardwick, Vt. (AP) _ A computer course has been added to theactivities for blind and visually impaired children at CampWapanacki, one of the country's oldest camps devoted to theirinterests.   Campers between the ages of 6 and 21 can learn computer skillsalong with swimming, sail boarding, canoeing, rowing, camping, artsand crafts and the performing arts at the Wapanacki, operated bythe New York Institute for Special Education. The camp also isoffering a special session for blind adults and their families.   Vicky Tripodi, the camp director, says many of the campers livein urban areas, so the summer program offers them a chance to getoutdoors and exercise. The activities also let them learn newskills to help them cope at home, she says. --=   If you want a boat for fishing or water sports but don't havemuch storage space in your small house or apartment, a collapsibleboat may be the answer.

(AP) _ Two small planes in a convoy of eightcrashed within minutes and miles of each other as they werereturning from a dinner outing, authorities said Saturday. Fourpeople died in one crash and three were injured in the other.   Both planes went down in bad weather Friday night, but the fatalcrash was not discovered until Saturday morning, police said.   Survivors of the other crash said all eight planes had flownabout 60 miles from Newburyport, Mass., to Laconia, where thetravelers had dinner, said state Aeronautics Director Harold Buker.   The travelers returned to the airport in Laconia, 25 miles northof Concord, at about 9 p.m. Bad weather prompted two of the pilotsto stay in Laconia but the other six took off.   One plane crashed into a hill in Sanbornton, about five milessouthwest of Laconia. Three people from Massachusetts on boardsuffered sprains, cuts and other minor injuries.   The second plane crashed in woods in Northfield, about 10 milessouth of Laconia, but authorities busy with the Sanbornton crash didnot discover it immediately, Buker said.   ``I think they both happened within minutes of each other,'' hesaid.   A satellite passing overhead after rescuers finished work at theSanbornton site picked up an emergency signal from the downed Cessna172 in Northfield.   Killed in the crash were Harry Avakian, 63, and his wife,Beatrice Avakian, 62, of Newburyport, Mass., and Bruce Magoon, 60,and his wife, Alice Magoon, 60, of Manchester, Mass., saidNorthfield police dispatcher Diane Heath.   Of the other four planes that left Laconia, two arrived atNewburyport and two made it to Lawrence, Mass., about 15 miles tothe southwest.   The Federal Aviation Administration and National TransportationSafety Board were investigating both accidents.	.   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Chinese air force pilot flew his MiG-19jet fighter to the Nationalist-held offshore island of Quemoy today,the Defense Ministry said.   Lt. Chiang Wen-hao, 24, landed his fighter this afternoon after aflight from Longxi airport in China's southern Fujian province, theministry said in a statement.   Chiang, from the central Chinese province of Sichuan, wasattached to the 49th Chinese Air Force Division, the statement said.   The pilot is the first Chinese airman to defect to Taiwan sincethe June 3-4 bloody suppression of a pro-democracy movement in China.   The last Chinese pilot to defect to Taiwan, Liu Chih-yuan, now30, also flew a MiG-19 when he fled in 1987.   The Nationalist government rewarded him with 412 pounds of gold,then valued at about $3 million. He is now a member of Taiwan's airforce.   The Taiwan government has a sliding scale of gold rewards forChinese military defectors, calculated on the type of aircraft theybring out.   Officials said 14 Chinese military personnel have defected toTaiwan since 1949, when the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan afterlosing a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland.   Seven of the 14 flew planes to South Korea, the only Asian nationthat has diplomatic ties with the Nationalists. They were eventuallyallowed to settle in Taiwan, but South Korea kept the planes.   Since the June crackdown, dozens of Chinese have arrived inTaiwan in boats, claiming they wanted a better life, but they weresent back to the Chinese mainland. Officials said they could not beclassified as defectors.   Last month, a Chinese youth seeking political asylum in SouthKorea was given a Taiwan passport and later left for El Salvador.   Observers say the Nationalists are reluctant to accept Chinesepolitical refugees for fear the action would outrage Chineseauthorities.	. This also moved on generalnewswires	...

In 1983, DCI (Director of Central Intelligence) Casey askedSecretary of Defense Weinberger if the Department of Defense couldobtain infantry weapons that Israel had confiscated from PLOforces. Following discussions between Major General Meron of Israeland Retired Major General Richard Secord of the United Statesgovernment, Israel secretly provided several hundred tons ofweapons to the DoD on a grant basis in May 1983. This was known asOperation ``Tipped Kettle.'' In February 1984, the CIA again askedDoD if it could obtain additional PLO weapons from Israel at littleor no cost for CIA operational use. After negotiations betweenMarch 1984 and July 1984, Israel secretly provided the additionalweapons to DoD in Operation ``Tipped Kettle II.'' The DoD thentransferred the weapons to the CIA. Although CIA advised Congressthat the weapons would be used for various purposes, in fact manyof them were provided to the Nicaraguan resistance as appropriatedfunds ran out.   The effort to funnel materiel to the Contras at a time whenthere were limits on the amount of funds the USG could spend tosupport the resistance also found expression in 1984 in Project``Elephant Herd,'' under which the CIA was to stockpile weapons andmateriel provided by DoD at the lowest possible cost under theEconomy Act. ...	1.

Weconfirm the commitment each of us has undertaken to the principle ofmaking no concessions to terrorists or their sponsors and tocooperating, bilaterally and in all relevant international fora, incombatting terrorism. We reiterate our commitment to the policiesagreed at previous summits; in particular we condemn state-sponsoredterrorism. We are determined not to let terrorists remainunpunished, and to have them brought to justice within the frameworkof international law and in conformity with the rule of law. We callupon those states which have supported or encouraged terrorist actsto demonstrate by their actions that they have renounced suchpolicies. We reaffirm in particular our absolute condemnation of thetaking of hostages. We call on those holding hostages to releasethem immediately and unconditionally on those with influence overhostage-takers to use it to this end.   2. Deeply concerned for the safety of all travelers and outragedby the murderous attacks perpetrated against international civilaviation and the frequent threat to air transport safety fromterrorists groups, we reaffirm our commitment to the fight againstall forms of terrorism affecting civil aviation. We reiterate ourdetermination to contribute to reinforcing internationally agreedmeasures for protection against aircraft hijackings and sabotage.   3. We particularly condemn the recent attack on an aircraft overScotland, which killed 270 people. We have agreed to give priorityto preventing such attacks by further strengthening securitymeasures. We attach importance to the implementation of the workplan recently adopted by the ICAO Council for this purpose.   4. We have also agreed on the need for improved methods ofdetecting explosives. We endorse efforts currently under way in ICAOto develop, as a matter of high priority, an appropriateinternational regime for the marking of plastic and sheet explosivesfor detection.	1. We, the leaders of our seven countries and the representativesof the European Community, reaffirm the universal and supremeimportance which we attach to freedom, democracy and the promotionof human rights.   2. We see signs of this same desire for greater freedom anddemocracy in the East. The people there, including the young people,are reasserting these values and calling for a pluralist democraticsociety. Some of their leaders are aware of the positivecontribution that greater freedom and democracy can make to themodernization of their countries and are starting to make changes totheir laws, practices and institutions. Others are still endeavoringto resist this movement by taking repressive measures which westrongly condemn.   3. We hope that freedom will be broadened and democracystrengthened and that they will form the basis, after decades ofmilitary confrontation, ideological antagonism and mistrust, forincreased dialogue and cooperation. We welcome the reforms under wayand the prospects of lessening the division of Europe.   4. We call upon the Soviet government to translate its newpolicies and pronouncements into further concrete action at home andabroad. Military imbalances favoring the Soviet Union, both inEurope and in Asia, remain an objective threat to each of us. Ourgovernments must therefore continue to be vigilant and maintain thestrength of our countries. For the foreseeable future, there is noalternative for each of us, within existing alliances, tomaintaining a strategy of deterrence based upon an appropriate mixof adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces. In orderto hasten the advent of a world in which the weight of arms andmilitary strength is reduced, we recommit ourselves to the urgentpursuit of a global ban on chemical weapons, a conventional forcesbalance in Europe at the lowest possible level consistent with oursecurity requirements, and a substantial reduction in Soviet andAmerican strategic nuclear arms.   5. We offer the countries of the East the opportunity to developbalanced economic cooperation on a sound commercial basis consistentwith the security interests of each of our countries and with thegeneral principles of international trade. We have noteddevelopments of relations between the EEC and countries of the East,in particular the conclusion of an agreement with Hungary, theprogress already achieved during the current discussions with Polandand the opening of negotiations with the Soviet Union.   6. We welcome the process of reform under way in Poland andHungary. We recognize that the political changes taking place inthese countries will be difficult to sustain without economicprogress. Each of us is prepared to support this process and toconsider, as appropriate and in a coordinated fashion, economicassistance aimed at transforming and opening their economies in adurable manner. We believe that each of us should direct ourassistance to these countries so as to sustain the momentum ofreform through inward investment, joint ventures, transfer ofmanagerial skills, professional training and other ventures whichwould help develop a more competitive economy.   Each of us is developing concrete initiatives designed toencourage economic reforms to promote more competitive economies andto provide new opportunities for trade.   We agreed to work along with other interested countries andmultilateral institutions to concert support for the process ofreform under way in Hungary and Poland, in order to make ourmeasures of support more effective and mutually reinforcing. We willencourage further creative efforts by interested governments, thepublic and the private sectors in support of the reform process.   Concerning concerted support for reform in Poland and Hungary, wecall for a meeting with all interested countries which will takeplace in the next few weeks. We underline, for Poland, the urgentneed for food in present circumstances.   To these ends, we ask the Commission of the European Communitiesto take the necessary initiatives in agreement with the other memberstates of the Community, and to associate, besides the summitparticipants, all interested countries.   7. We are in favor of an early conclusion of the negotiationsbetween the IMF and Poland. The strengthened debt strategy isapplicable to Poland, provided it meets the conditions. We are readyto support in the Paris Club the rescheduling of Polish debtexpeditiously and in a flexible and forthcoming manner.   8. We see good opportunities for the countries of West and Eastto work together to find just solutions to conflicts around theworld, to fight against under-development, to safeguard theresources and the environment and to build a freer and more openworld.''	1.

Under the Plaza and Louvre agreements, our countries agreedto pursue, in a mutually reinforcing way, policies of surveillanceand coordination aimed at improving their economic fundamentals andat fostering stability of exchange rates consistent with thoseeconomic fundamentals.   There has been progress in the multilateral surveillance andcoordination of economic policies with a view to ensuring internalconsistency of domestic policies and their internationalcompatibility. The procedures to be used have been more clearlydefined and improved in cooperation with the International MonetaryFund.   11. The coordination process has made a positive contribution toworld economic development and it has also contributed greatly toimproving the functioning of the International Monetary System.There has also been continued cooperation in exchange markets.   It is important to continue, and where appropriate, to developthis cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioningand the stability of the International Monetary System in a mannerconsistent with economic fundamentals. We therefore ask the financeministers to continue to keep under review possible steps that couldbe taken to improve the coordination process, exchange marketcooperation, and the functioning of the International MonetarySystem.   12. We welcome the decision to complete the work on the ninthreview of the International Monetary Fund quotas with a view to adecision on this matter before the end of the years.   We note that the question of a resumption of SDR allocationremains under consideration in the Executive Board of theInternational Monetary Fund.   13. Within the European Community, the European Monetary Systemhas contributed to a significant degree of economic policyconvergence and monetary stability.	10. Washington, 1,589, 37.5.	10.

We will continue to promote measures in order to removeinefficiencies in our economies. These inefficiencies affect manyaspects of economic activity, reduce potential growth rates and theprospects for job creation, diminish the effectiveness ofmacroeconomic policies and impede the external adjustment process.   In this context, tax reforms, modernization of financial markets,strengthening of competition policies and reducing rigidities in allsectors including energy, industry and agriculture are necessary. Soare the improvement of education and vocational training,transportation and distribution systems and further policies aimedat giving more flexibility and mobility to the labor market andreducing unemployment.   Within the European Community, the steady progress towardcompletion by the end of 1992 of the program contained in the SingleAct has already given a strong momentum to economic efficiency.   15. The decline of saving in some of our countries in this decadeis a cause of concern. This lower level of saving can contribute tohigh real interest rates and therefore hamper growth. Inadequatesaving and large fiscal deficits are associated with large externaldeficits. We recommend, within the frameweork of policycoordination, policies to encourage saving and remove hinderanceswhere they exist.   16. Financial activities are being increasingly carried out withnew techniques on a worldwide basis. As regards insider trading,which could hamper the credibility of financial markets, regulationsvary greatly among our countries. These regulations have beenrecently, or are in the process of being, strengthened.International cooperation should be pursued and enhanced.	1475      7.88    r    r  0.18  0.62  1.041500      5.64  6.26  6.82  0.42  1.06  1.641525      3.68  4.54  5.20  0.92  1.82  2.481550      2.14  3.12  3.86  1.88  2.88  3.561575      1.08  2.06  2.76  3.32  4.24  4.921600      0.50  1.28  1.92  5.22  5.98  6.541625      0.24  0.76  1.28  7.42  8.60  8.36Prev.day calls vol. 1,283 Open int. 10,649	148, Amos Barr Hostetter Jr., $500, Boston, cable TV, 52.	148, M.

We strongly reaffirm our determination tofight it in all its forms.   We shall fulfill the Punta de Este standstill and rollbackcommitments which, inter alia, require the avoidance of any traderestrictive or distorting measure inconsistent with the provisionsof the General Agreement and its instruments.   We agree to make effective use of the improved GATT disputesettlement mechanism and to make progress in negotiations forfurther improvements. We will avoid any discriminatory or autonomousactions, which undermined the principles of the GATT and theintegrity of the multilateral trading system.   We also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism,bilateralism, sectoralism and managed trade which threatens toundermine the multilateral system and Uruguay Round negotiations.   18. The successful negotiation of the Trade NegotiationsCommittee of the Uruguay Round in Geneva last April, therebycompleting the midterm review, is a very important achievement. Itgives a clear framework for future work in all sectors including thepursuit of agricultural reform in the short term as well as in thelong term. It also gives the necessary framework for substantivenegotiations in important sectors not yet fully included in GATTdisciplines, such as services, trade-related investment measures andintellectural property.   Developed countries participated actively in these negotiationsand contributed to this success. All countries should make theirmost constructive contribution possible.   We express our full commitment to making further substantiveprogress in the Uruguay Round in order to complete it by the end of1990.   19. We note with satisfaction the entry into force of the FreeTrade Agreeement betwen Canada and the United States, as well asmore recent initiatives to intensify the close economic relationsbetween the European Community and EFTA countries. It remains ourpolicy that these and other developments in regional cooperation,should be trade-creating and complementary to the multilateralliberalization process.   20. It is the firm intention of the European Community that thetrade aspects of the single market program should also betrade-creating and complementary to the multilateral liberalizationprocess.   21. We note with satisfaction the progress that has been made instrengthening the multilateral disciplines on trade and aiddistorting export credit subsidies. This effort must be pursuedactively and completed in the competent bodies of the OECD with aview to improving present guidelines at the earliest possible date.	1770: Benjamin Franklin, then a colonial agent in England, sendshome America's first soybeans.   1845-9: The Irish potato famine kills more than 1 million peopleand turns 2.5 million others into emigrants.

Year IV of ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's driv to refashion Sovieteconomy and society, will bring the first national multicandidateelections in decades, part of the his campaign for``democratization,'' and continued streamlining in the economy.   But at the dawn of the year, as Moscow shivered in subzero cold,such common items as detergent, bath soap, chickens, coffee,toothpaste, sugar, yeast and candy were hard to find or completelyabsent from state-run stores.   On Sunday the Kremlin announced an export ban on goods rangingfrom caviar to children's shoes, an apparent attempt to hoardchronically scarce Soviet-made products for Soviet consumers.   In his televised New Year's Eve message, Gorbachev told his 285million countrymen that improvements in their lives would be gradualat best in the coming months, and that there would be no miracles.   ``It is wrong to think, comrades, that somebody will solve ourproblems for us and that everything around us will change at thewave of a magic wand, with the chime of the clock on New Year'sEve,'' he said.   ``We see now that it is essential to act with greaterresoluteness,'' said Gorbachev, Soviet leader since March 1985. ``Weare not awaiting and we are not promising manna from heaven, knowingwell that the burden of unresolved issues is heavy, and our road isdifficult.''   For some, that message may have seemed distressingly likeGorbachev's forecast at the beginning of 1988, when he said``immense and hard work'' lay ahead in his drive for economic change.   The multibillion-ruble cost of rebuilding areas of northwesternArmenia shattered by the Dec. 7 earthquake also will cause shortagesin the economy, for example in building materials, Prime MinisterNikolai I. Ryzhkov has said.   On Jan. 1, all 48,000 state-run enterprises in the nation wereput on a pay-their-own-way basis, meaning they are deprived ofgovernment subsidies and forced to find ways to generate enoughrevenue to meet costs and payroll.   For Soviet managers accustomed to top-heavy centralized controls,which severely limited their initiative but also freed them frommany decision-making responsibilities, ``self-accounting'' is amixed blessing.   They are free to negotiate contracts and pursue theonce-forbidden goal of making a profit, but also in theory may facebankruptcy if they fail.   The nation's 130 million workers, too, can theoretically earnmore if they produce more, but run the risk of layoffs if theirfactory trims its labor force to cut costs.   According to Radio Moscow, enterprises that account for 60percent of Soviet industrial output have been on ``self-accounting''since January 1988. The jury is still out, however, on whether theyhave gained much freedom.   One Soviet economist, Nikolai Shmelov, has said governmentbureaucrats still exercise effective control over some branches ofthe economy by issuing them 80 percent and more of their orders theymust fill.   In March, voters will be called to elect the members of a newCouncil of People's Deputies that will choose their membership oftheir national parliament and name a head of state with increasedpowers.   The sole candidate for the new presidential post is widelyexpected to be the 57-year-old Gorbachev himself, posing furtherquestions about how democratic the Kremlin's ``democratization''process can or will be.   At lower levels, however, voters will be able to choose from morethan one candidate, in contrast to past practice, when electoralnominees were selected according to social status, age and sex tofill quotas fixed in Moscow.   1989 will also bring uncertainty in international relations, asthe Kremlin seeks a working relationship with a new U.S. presidentand decides whether to complete its now-frozen military withdrawalfrom Afghanistan in time to meet a U.N.-brokered Feb. 15 deadline.   Shortly before Gorbachev went on TV with his New Year's message,the official news agency Tass transmitted new year's greetings toEnglish-language subscribers along with the image of a snake, areminder that according to Oriental astrology, 1989 is the Year ofthe Snake.   Some Soviets, in humor or in earnest, note that past such yearsin the 12-year Oriental cycle have been the occasion of tragic orcataclysmic happenings in their homeland, and predict an eventful1989.   In 1905, there was an abortive anti-czarist revolution. In 1917,the Bolshevik Revolution brought the Communists to power. In 1929,dictator Josef V.

In 1948, there was big news in the commercial truck industry.It was:   a. Diesel-powered models outsold gasoline-powered trucks.   b. Posted clearance measurements became mandatory on bridgesover highways.   c. Sales topped 1 million units.   d. The Good Humor vehicle rang its chimes for the first time.	2. In late March 1984, National Security Adviser Robert C.McFarlane suggested that he pursue funding alternatives for the(Nicaraguan) resistance for use after congressional funding ranout. ...   4. In early 1984, in a discussion with the ambassador from SaudiArabia, McFarlane encouraged that country to support theresistance. A short time later, the ambassador informed McFarlanethat his government would contribute $1 million per month. Themoney became available during the early summer of 1984.   5. On June 25, 1984, the National Security Planning Group(``NSPG'') _ including President Reagan, Vice President Bush,Secretary of State Shultz, Secretary of Defense Weinberger, DCI(Director of Central Intelligence) Casey, U.N. AmbassadorKirkpatrick, CJCS (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) Vessey,Admiral Moreau, Counselor to the President Meese, McFarlane andAdmiral Poindexter (among others) _ discussed third country fundingfor the resistance. ...   7. At a meeting in mid-July 1984 between DCI Casey, Deputy DCIJohn McMahon and Deputy Secretary of State Dam, Casey indicatedthat those present ought to get moving on non-USG (U.S. government)funding for the resistance since Attorney General Smith hadrecently concluded that raising the funds in this manner would notbe an impeachable offense, as had been suggested at the NSPGmeeting on June 25, 1984. ...   16. In early 1985, President Reagan urged the head of state ofSaudi Arabia to continue its support for the resistance. SaudiArabia subsequently made a contribution of more than $25 million....   20. In mid-April 1985, Lt. Col. North advised McFarlane that theresistance had received a total of $24.5 million since appropriatedfunds had run out, of which more than $17 million had gone forarms, munitions, combat operations, and combat support activities....   22. In early August 1985, the White House and various CIAstations learned of reports that, during the visit of David Kimcheto the U.S. in May 1985, he had met with Michael Armacost, the U.S.undersecretary for political affairs, and had negotiated thecontinuation of military aid from Israel to Central America. ...   32. In mid-May 1986, Donald Fortier, the director ofpolitical-military affairs at the NSC, was advised that thesituation for the resistance was bleak. President Reagan needed topursue means of obtaining additional aid promptly, includingtalking personally to heads of state to tell them that he wasdispatching a special emissary with his personal request for theirassistance to the resistance. ...	2.

Qxa2 Nxe3	2:00 p.m. _ An army broadcast warns students to return theweapons from the supply bus captured at the Liubu intersection,about a mile west of the 100-acre Tiananmen Square. They ignore thewarning.   2:10 p.m. _ Riot police burst out from Zhongnanhai, headquartersof the Communist Party. Tear gas is used in Beijing for the firsttime in Communist China's 40-year history.   Security forces beat dozens of people mercilessly at the Liubuintersection. A woman falls down and policemen kick her. They grabher hair and beat her face with truncheons.   The weapons are recovered.   Demonstrators, their faces and chests bloodied, walk away inshock. A man with wounds to his head and back staggers down analleyway. ``My God! my God!'' he spits through shattered teeth.   After seven weeks of peaceful protest, the government had lostits patience.   A mile away, also at 2:10 p.m., about 5,000 unarmed soldiersmarched out of the Great Hall of the People but were blocked fromTiananmen by throngs of students and a city bus. It was the closestsoldiers had been to the square since martial law was declared May20.   ``If you want to shoot, shoot me!'' screamed a 73-year-old womanin pajamas. ``Just don't shoot the students.''   The mood moved like the sea of people. At one stage, the soldierssang military songs and the students applauded.   But the hot day wore on and tempers flared. A few soldiers lashedout with their belts. Rocks, tree branches and beer bottles flewbetween the two sides, and several people were bloodied.   Fighting abated and the standoff continued until 8 p.m., when thesoldiers returned to the Great Hall. Students shook their hands andpatted them on the back.   Half an hour later, thousands of people gathered on the bridge atMuxudi, the western gateway to the inner city. Crowds moved buses toblock passage to the bridge by massing troops.   The first wave of troops from the 27th Army charged toward thebridge at 10 p.m., firing tear gas and swinging clubs.   Burning rugs from a nearby apartment were thrown onto the busbarricades. A gas tank exploded, then another. The sky flickeredorange and black. Bullets whistled and richocheted. Tear gascanisters boomed.   ``Fascists! Fascists!'' the crowd chanted.   It was 11 o'clock. The soldiers opened fire, aiming low.   ``Live fire! Live fire!'' a student shouted, moments after abullet hit his leg.   Blood pooled on the pavement, spattered the bridge at Muxudi.   Gasoline bombs flew from the crowd at a tank. People surgedaround the tank, pulled two crewmen out and beat them senseless.   The civilians set the tank ablaze, with red flags reading``Democracy'' and ``Freedom'' flapping from its turrets.   Midnight comes, and with it the first breakthrough. Armoredpersonnel carriers smash through the blockade and head east towardthe square.   ``Clear the street! Clear the way!'' a medic yells.   Bloodied residents, sprawled on three-wheeled pedicabs andhowling with pain, are pushed up side streets. Ill-equipped doctorspound on chests and apply makeshift bandages. Their lips are redwith blood from mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.   ``He's gone; we've lost him!'' a medic yells as a man with abullet hole in his chest gurgles and shakes.   ``This is China! This is my country!'' a man screams, pointingdown the street where soldiers crouch and fire from the shadows.   A line of 50 troop trucks plows through the crumpled roadblock.Soldiers fire into the air. A cleaning woman on the 14th floor iskilled by gunfire and another woman is hit as she looks out from aneighth floor balcony.   An armored personnel carrier careens along the north side ofTiananmen Square and is greeted by gasoline bombs.   A second armored vehicle turns up the west side of the Great Hallof the People and the crowd stops it by hurling chunks of concrete.People pound the armor with sticks and pelt it with rocks.	2:55 a.m. (1:55 p.m. EST Thursday): Firing at Villamor betweenrebels and pro-government forces.

Growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improvingthe efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengtheningour cooperative efforts and the coordination process. In the mediumterm, the current buoyant investment seen during this period shouldpave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and helpreduce the dangers of inflation. The outlook is not, however,without risks.   4. Until now, the threat of inflation in many countries has beencontained, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments andmonetary authorities. But continued vigilance is required andinflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a firmpolicy response so that it will be put on a downward path.   5. While some progress has been made in reducing externalimbalances, the momentum of adjustment has recently weakenedmarkedly; there needs to be further progress in adjusting externalimbalances through cooperation.   6. In countries with fiscal and current account deficits,including the United States of America, Canada and Italy, furtherreductions in budget deficits are needed. Action will be taken tobring them down. This may help reduce the savings-investment gap andexternal imbalances, contribute to countering inflation andencourage greater exchange rate stability in a context of decreasinginterest rates.   7. Countries with external surpluses, including Japan andGermany, should continue to pursue appropriate macroeconomicpolicies and structural reforms that will encourage non-inflationarygrowth of domestic demand and facilitate external adjustment.   8. All our countries share the responsibility for the sounddevelopment of the world economy. Over the medium term, deficitcountries have to play a key role in global adjustment through theirexternal adjustment and increased exports; surplus countries have tocontribute to sustaining global expansion through policies providingfavorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports.   9. The emergence of the newly industrializing economies and theinitiation of a dialogue with them are welcome. We call on thosewith substantial surpluses to contribute to the adjustment ofexternal imbalances and the open trade and payments system. To thatend, they should permit exchange rates to reflect their competitiveposition, implement GATT commitments and reduce trade barriers.	3.

Our approach to the debt problems has produced signficantresults, but serious challenges remain: In many countries the ratioof debt service to exports remains high, financing for growthpromoting investment is scarce, and capital flight is a key problem.An improvement in the investment climate must be a critical part ofefforts to achieve a sustainable level of growth without excessivelevels of debt. These improvements of the current situation dependabove all on sustained and effective adjustment policies in thedebtor countries.   31. To address these challenges, we are strongly committed to thestrengthened debt strategy. This will rely, on a case-by-case basis,on the following actions:   _Borrowing countries should implement, with the assistance of theFund and the Bank, sound economic policies, particularly designed tomobilize savings, stimulate investment and reverse capital flight;   _Banks should increasingly focus on voluntary, market-based debtand debt service reduction operations, as a complement to newlending;   _The International Monetary Fund and World Bank will supportsignificant debt reduction by setting aside a portion ofpolicy-based loans;   _Limited interest support will be provided, through additionalfinancing by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, fortransactions involving significant debt and debt service reduction.For that purpose the use of escrow accounts is agreed;   _Continued Paris Club rescheduling and flexibility ofexport-credit agencies;   _Strengthening of the international financial institutionscapability for supporting medium-term macroeconomic and structuraladjustment programs and for compensating the negative effects ofexport shortfalls and external shocks.   32. In the framework of this strategy:   _We welcome the recent decisions taken by the two institutions toencourage debt and debt service reduction which provide adequateresources for these purposes;   _We urge debtor countries to move ahead promptly to developstrong economic reform programs that may lead to debt and debtservice reductions in accordance with the guidelines defined by thetwo Bretton Woods institutions;   _We urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches intheir negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly toconclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction,debt service reduction and new money. We stress that officialcreditors should not substitute for private lenders. Our governmentsare prepared to consider as appropriate tax, regulatory andaccounting practices with a view to eliminating unnecessaryobstacles to debt and debt service reductions.	30.

There is growing awareness throughout the world of thenecessity to preserve better the global ecological balance. Thisincludes serious threats to the atmosphere, which could lead tofuture climate changes. We note with great concern the growingpollution of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas; acid rain;dangerous substances; and the rapid desertification anddeforestation. Such environmental degradation endangers species andundermines the well-being of individuals and societies.   Decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect theEarth's ecological balance. We will work together to achieve thecommon goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environmentin order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carryout obligations to future generations.   34. We urge all countries to give further impetus to scientificresearch on environmental issues, to develop necessary technologiesand to make clear evaluations of the economic costs and benefits ofenvironmental policies.   The persisting uncertainty on some of these issues should notunduly delay our action.   In this connection, we ask all countries to combine their effortsin order to improve observation and monitoring on a global scale.   35. We believe that international cooperation also needs to beenhanced in the field of technology and technology transfer in orderto reduce pollution or provide alternative solutions.   36. We believe that industry has a crucial role in preventingpollution at source, in waste minimization, in energy conservation,and in the design and marketing of cost-effective cleantechnologies. The agricultural sector must also contribute totackling problems such as water pollution, soil erosion anddesertification.   37. Environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade,development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning.Therefore, environmental considerations must be taken into accountinto economic decision-making. In fact, good economic policies andgood environmental policies are mutually reinforcing.   In order to achieve sustainable development, we shall ensure thecompatibility of economic growth and development with the protectionof the environment. Environmental protection and related investmentshould contribute to economic growth. In this respect, intensifiedefforts for technological breakthrough are important to reconcileeconomic growth and environmental policies.	333 Bush Street, San Francisco	34. Illinois, 3,157, 27.5.	34.

In early July 1984, a CIA officer reported to CIAheadquarters that Honduras was taking the position that it wouldcontinue to support the resistance following the U.S. fundingcutoff, but resistance operations would have to be covert to avoidpolitical embarrassment to Honduras.   43. In mid-August 1984, Poindexter discussed with PresidentReagan and others a proposal ascribed to Secretary Shultz thatwould permit Congress to ``wink'' at lethal support for theresistance. Under Shultz's plan, the U.S. government would supplynon-lethal aid directly to the resistance. The U.S. governmentwould provide military aid to El Salvador, which in turn wouldprovide lethal aid to the Resistance. ...   53. On February 19, 1985, McFarlane sent a memorandum toPresident Reagan informing him of the recommendation of the CPPG(Crisis Pre-Planning Group) to provide incentives to Honduras sothat it would maintain its aid to the resistance. ... It furtherrecommended a presidential letter to the leader of Honduras, to bedelivered by an emissary who would very privately explain U.S.criteria for the expedited economic support, security assistancedeliveries, and other support. President Reagan personallyauthorized the entire plan.   54. Later in February 1985, President Reagan sent theagreed-upon message to (Honduran President) Suazo via the U.S.ambassador. The letter urged that Honduras do all in its power tosupport ``those who struggle for freedom and democracy.'' Shortlythereafter, McFarlane sent a memorandum to Shultz, Weinberger,Casey, and Vessey informing them that President Reagan's letter hadbeen sent and proposing steps to be taken to implement thepresident's intent. The memorandum requested DoD (Department ofDefense) to commence expedited delivery of military items, aspreviously planned and personally authorized by President Reagan,and it requested necessary documentation to enhance other supportprograms in Honduras. ...   58. When Vice President Bush met with President Suazo, Bush toldSuazo that President Reagan had directed expedited delivery of U.S.military items to Honduras. Vice President Bush also informed Suazothat President Reagan had directed that currently withheld economicassistance for Honduras should be released; that the United Stateswould provide from its own military stocks critical securityassistance items that had been ordered by Honduran armed forces,and that several security programs under way for Honduran securityforces would be enhanced. ...	42.

There is a particular problem with thedeterioration of coastal waters. To ensure the sustainablemanagement of the marine environment, we recognize the importance ofinternational cooperation in preserving it and conserving the livingresources of the sea. We call for the relevant bodies of the UnitedNations to prepare a report on the state of the world's oceans.   We express our concern that national, regional and globalcapabilities to contain and alleviate the consequences of maritimeoil spills be improved. We urge all countries to make better use ofthe latest monitoring and clean-up technologies. We ask allcountries to adhere to and implement fully the internationalconventions for the prevention of oil pollution of the oceans. Wealso ask the International Maritime Organization to put forwardproposals for further preventive action.   47. We are committed to ensuring full implementation of existingrules for the environment. In this respect, we note with interestthe initiative of the Italian government to host in 1990 a forum oninternational law for the environment with scholars, scientificexperts and officials, to consider the need for a digest of existingrules and to give in-depth consideration to the legal aspects ofenvironment at the international level.   48. We advocate that existing environment institutions bestrengthened within the United Nations system. In particular, theUnited Nations Environment Program urgently requires strengtheningand increased financial support. Some of us have agreed that theestablishment within the United Nations of a new institution mayalso be worth considering.   49. We have taken note of the report of the sixth conference onbioethics held in Brussels which examined the elaboration of auniversal code of environmental ethics based upon the concept of the``human stewardship of nature.''   50. It is a matter of international concern that Bangladesh, oneof the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world, isperiodically devastated by catastrophic floods.   We stress the urgent need for effective, coordinated action bythe international community, in support of the government ofBangladesh, in order to find solutions to this major problem whichare technically, financially, economically and environmentallysound. In that spirit, and taking account of help already given, wetake note of the different studies concerning flood alleviation,initiated by France, Japan, the U.S. and the United NationsDevelopment Program, which have been reviewed by experts from allour countries. We welcome the World Bank's agreement, followingthose studies, to coordinate the efforts of the internationalcommunity so that a sound basis for achieving a real improvement inalleviating the effects of flood can be established. We also welcomethe agreement of the World Bank to chair, by the end of the year, ameeting to be held in the United Kingdom by invitation of theBangladesh government, of the countries willing to take an activepart in such a program.   51. We give political support to projects such as the jointproject to set up an observatory of the Saharan areas, which answersthe need to monitor the development of that rapidly deteriorating,fragile, arid region, in order to protect it more effectively.	46.

The drug problem has reached devastating proportions. Westress the urgent need for decisive action, both on a national andan international basis. We urge all countries, especially thosewhere drug production, trading and consumption are large, to joinour efforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and tocarry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and thelaundering of its proceeds.   53. Accordingly, we resolve to take the following measures withinrelevant fora:   _Give greater emphasis on bilateral and United Nations programsfor the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries.The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), and otherUnited Nations and multilateral organizations should be supported,strengthened and made more effective. These efforts could includeparticular support for the implementation of effective programs tostop drug cultivation and trading as well as developmental andtechnical assistance.   _Support the efforts of producing countries who ask forassistance to counter illegal production or trafficking.   _Strengthen the role of the United Nations in the war againstdrugs through an increase in its resources and through reinforcedeffectiveness of its operation.   _Intensify the exchange of information on the prevention ofaddiction, and rehabilitation of drug addicts.   _Support the international conference planned for l990 on cocaineand drug demand reduction.   _Strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative and mutualassistance on these issues, the first steps being a prompt adhesionto, ratification and implementation of the Vienna Convention onillicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.   _ Conclude further bilateral or multilateral agreements andsupport initiatives and cooperation, where appropriate, whichinclude measures to facilitate the identification, tracing,freezing, seizure and forfeiture of drug crime proceeds.   _Convene a financial action task force from summit participantsand other countries interested in these problems. Its mandate is toassess the results of cooperation already undertaken in order toprevent the utilization of the banking system and financialinstitutions for the purpose of money laundering, and to consideradditional preventive efforts in this field, including theadaptation of the legal and regulatory systems so as to enhancemultinational judicial assistance. The first meeting of this taskforce will be called by France and its report will be completed byApril 1990.	54.

On April 25, 1985, McFarlane informed President Reagan thatmilitary support for the resistance from Honduras was in jeopardyas a consequence of the House vote refusing to provide new fundsfor the resistance.

During thecall between the two leaders, Suazo urged that the U.S. governmentcontinue to oppose communism.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Federal Aviation Administration. wantsairlines to replace thousands of rivets on more than 600 olderBoeing 727s. The goverment also wants them to initiate inspectionprocedures until the modifications can be completed.   The FAA estimated Friday that the repairs and extra inspectionsof 623 older Boeing 727s will cost the airlines approximately $35.7million.   The proposed directive on the Boeing 727s requires that airlinesover the next four years replace from 3,300 to 4,150 rivets,depending on the model of 727 involved. It said the ``countersunk''rivets now on the planes are believed to cause cracking under somecircumstances, while the substitute ``button-head'' is less likelyto do so.   The proposed FAA directive is similar to an order issued lastOctober for older Boeing 737s. A final order will not be issueduntil after a brief comment period.   tps@	77. J.C.

In late August 1986, North reported to Admiral Poindexterthat a representative of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega had askedNorth to meet with him. Noriega's representative proposed that, inexchange for a promise from the USG to help clean up Noriega'simage and a commitment to lift the USG ban on military sales to thePanamanian defense forces, Noriega would assassinate the Sandinistaleadership for the U.S. government. North had told Noriega'srepresentative that U.S. law forbade such actions. Therepresentative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in placein Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things, just asNoriega had helped the USG the previous year in blowing up aSandinista arsenal. ...   98. North advised Admiral Poindexter that the British personswho had run the operation against the arsenal had used a Panamaniancivilian ordnance expert. North noted that Noriega had thecapabilities that he had proffered, and that the cost of anyoperations could be borne by Project Democracy.   99. Admiral Poindexter responded that if Noriega had assetsinside Nicaragua, he could be helpful. The USG could not beinvolved in assassination, but Panamanian assistance with sabotagewould be another story. Admiral Poindexter recommended that Northspeak with Noriega directly. ...   106. In late September 1986, Lt. Col. North reported to AdmiralPoindexter on his London meeting with Noriega. Noriega would try totake immediate actions against the Sandinistas and offered a listof priorities including an oil refinery, an airport, and the PuertoSandino off-load facility.	9:05 a.m. (8:05 p.m. EST Thursday): Rebel spokesman broadcastsstatement over radio DZXL but is cut off after asking for prayersfor ``those leaders pretending to be leaders.''	9:30-10                      20,500,000  17,900,0009:30-11                      49,420,000  43,200,0009:30-12                      71,800,000  68,000,000	9:50 a.m. (8:50 p.m. EST Thursday): Government helicopter firesat rebel-controlled government station; rebel plane fires rocket atchannel 9 broadcasting government statements.	:Home Video Reviews	;ADDS byline.	;SUBS grfs 13-19 pvs,``The new...its principles...' with 4 to trim, delete redundancies.	</TEXT><BYLINE>Ohio</BYLINE><TEXT>      Leslie Herbert Wexner, $2,000, Columbus, The Limited Inc., 52.

Andrus, on behalf of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corporation(``TXO''). The letter provided Andrus with background informationon TXO and its dispute with the Arkla Exploration Company overmineral exploration leases on land in Arkansas.   Wright held no interest in TXO at any relevant time. Asdiscussed in Section III. A. of this Report, from February 1979until March 1984 Wright held an interest in the Whatley well, aneast-Texas natural gas well drilled and operated by TXO. However,as an investor in the well, Wright's financial return wasdetermined only by the productivity of the well and could not havebeen affected by TXO's success or failure with respect to theArkansas leases. Wright's letter did not comment upon the merits ofthe dispute between TXO and Arkla. Therefore, it is not aprohibited ex parte communication under the Government in theSunshine Act, Pub. L. 94-409, 4, Stat. 1241, 1246, 5 U.S.C. 557(d).   The letter was the only communication on the subject betweenWright or his staff and Andrus or his staff. Therefore, the letterwas not an exercise of undue influence by Wright. Furthermore,Andrus and undersecretary James A. Joseph both stated that theletter made no demand or request that they deemed unusual orimproper. Nor did the letter affect the decision made by thedepartment with respect to the leases.   As discussed in full in Section III.

Israel, they have discovered, is beset by a chaotic politicalsystem and deep social divisions between religious and secular Jews.Even more disturbing to some is the harsh repression of thePalestinian uprising that has been going on for more than a yearnow. More than 385 Palestinians have died.   Natan Sharansky, whose 12-year emigration battle made him a heroof Soviet Jewry, has found his loyalties torn between his Jewishpatriotism and his concern for human rights.   Two of his former colleagues in the fight inside the Soviet Union_ Ida Nudel and Yosef Begun _ have been stunned more by the coolreception that many Soviet immigrants receive in Israel.   ``The situation of the immigrants here is so bad. After devoting20 years of my life to this issue, it is very painful for me to facewhat is happening,'' said Nudel, known as the ``Guardian Angel'' forrisking her own life to help other Jews in prison.   These and other activists say that stories about suchdifficulties filtering back home are a major reason why most Jewsleaving the Soviet Union today, under the glasnost policies ofMikhail Gorbachev, are chosing to live someplace besides Israel.   In 1988, Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union hit aneight-year high of 20,082. But only 7 percent came to Israel _ arecord ``dropout'' rate since the emigration struggle began twodecades ago. In those years, about 255,000 Soviet Jews have settledin Israel.   Nudel, whose cause was championed by U.S. Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz and stars like Jane Fonda, typifies the loneliness andisolation experienced by many immigrants.   She arrived in October 1987 after being a ``refusenik'' _ theterm for those refused an exit visa _ for 16 years. She stillsuffers backaches from eight years in exile in Siberia and inBendery, south of Moscow, as punishment for her anti-Soviet activism.   Nudel, 57, is a graying and bespectacled woman who stands4-foot-10. She is single in a family-oriented society. She recentlygave away her pet dog, Pizer, brought all the way from Siberia,after it proved too much for her tiny, three-room apartment. Herpoor understanding of Hebrew makes even watching television a chore.   She spends most of her time at the apartment of her sister, ElanaFridman, occasionally venturing out to try to help fellow immigrantsthrough the maze of Israeli bureaucracy to find jobs and housing.   She says she was torn between conflicting impulses _ the need torebuild her own life and the desire to once again lead a fight forJews from her native land.   ``To be a symbol for a lifetime is too much for any humanbeing,'' Nudel says. ``Physically, I also don't feel very strong,but I feel I cannot rest.''   Mrs. Fridman, who spearheaded the campaign for her sister'srelease, is frustrated that Nudel is no longer treated as a heroine.   ``Everyone understands that people like her made history, thatthese are people who suffered as Jews, but I think that there is notenough admiration shown,'' Mrs. Fridman says. ``This hurts.''   During an interview in her sister's apartment, Nudel sitsuneasily on the sofa, occasionally massaging the side of her weakback. She turns the conversation away from herself to focus on theplight of immigrants in general.   ``I think there is a crisis in the ideology Israel was builtupon,'' she says. ``Today every newcomer is considered a nuisance.We should be considering them a blessing.''   The well-known refuseniks, who receive government stipends or canmake a living writing about their experiences, do not share thepoverty of most Soviet immigrants.   For them, the main problem is dealing with the gap between whatwas a dream and what is the harsh reality of Israel, says YuriStern, a spokesman for the Soviet Jewry Education and InformationCenter.   ``It takes such tremendous effort and concentration to overcomethe fears in the Soviet Union, that to survive you need to pictureIsrael in an idyllic way,'' Stern says. ``Then you come here, yousee that it is a real country, reality, not a dream.''   What the refuseniks and other Soviet immigrants find is thatIsraelis, most of whom are Middle Eastern and not European, havelittle concern for the plight of the new immigrants.   Many native-born Israelis recall their parents' hard times in anew country 40 years ago and speak resentfully of the smallgovernment aid given to newcomers.   ``Israelis say they don't understand why the Russians shout. Theysay, `When we came here back in the 1950s, we lived in tents.' Butthis is a different time, nobody lives in tents anymore,'' saysYosef Begun, 56, the former refusenik who waged a 17-year battle toemigrate.   Begun spent about a decade in and out of jail, discarding hisprofession as a mathematician to help revive the study of Hebrewlanguage and culture in Moscow. He arrived in Israel about a yearago.   Unlike Nudel, Begun has found his niche in Jerusalem's religiouscommunity and basks in his newfound freedom.   ``After the snows of Moscow where people wore gloomy facesbecause there was never enough food, here we are in a blossoming,colorful country,'' the bearded Begun says, seated by a windowoverlooking Jerusalem's old walled city.	</TEXT><NOTE>By ANDREW KATELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LENINGRAD, U.S.S.R.

These and other eye-opening images are flashing across Soviettelevision screens as glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sdrive for openness, goes video.   Traditionally, the Kremlin has used state-run television as itdid other media _ to reach the masses with propaganda, rather thanprograms about things that directly affect their lives or were justplain fun. The airwaves are still full of dull documentaries onsubjects such as the grain harvest. The leadership still commandsunlimited time, and news shows spend a lot of time reporting listsof government leaders seeing each other off on trips.   But Gorbachev is a more lively TV personality than hispredecessors, and frequently turns to television to make speechesand broadcast his street-side talks with people. For the first timethis winter, parliamentary candidates debated each other ontelevision.   Western music videos are shown routinely, ``space bridges''bring the uncensored views of Western studio audiences into Sovietliving rooms, and an occasional foreign commercial or film givesSoviets a glimpse of Western lifestyles.   One trailblazing program, which featured the offbeat storiesabout the bull, the prostitutes and the bombing, is ``600Seconds,'' a fast-paced live show on Leningrad television that hasbecome a smash hit since its premiere in December 1987.   One avid fan of 30-year-old anchorman Alexander Nezorov said theprogram ``shows the Soviet people what they were torn away from alltheir lives, things that we learned to close our eyes to.''   Six days a week, 15 million people in Leningrad, Moscow andother regions can switch on their TV sets to catch up on the latestsensations from the Soviet Union's second-largest city.   ``600 Seconds,'' the news magazine show ``Fifth Wheel,'' thedebate program ``Public Opinion'' and the music discussion program``Musical Boxing Ring'' make Leningrad television among the mostprogressive in the Soviet Union, reinforcing the reputation of thecity built by Peter the Great as a window on the West.   ``600 Seconds'' is like a cross between ``Ripley's Believe It orNot'' and ``60 Minutes.'' Leningraders have nicknamed the show,``Our City Scandal-Monger.''   At 10 p.m., a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutesof news reports read live by a studio announcer, and videotapedreports presented rapid-fire in a down-to-earth style. A digitalclock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down theremaining seconds.   Everything about the show sets it apart from ordinarybroadcasts, which are presented in formal language in detail, andare visually dull.   The show's popularity is evident to the staff. About 200 callsand dozens of letters a day pour into the tiny, dingy room inLeningrad's TV center where two harried producers and Nevzorov workunder a crumbling portrait of Lenin. Ironically, no portrait ofGorbachev, whose glasnost policy made the program possible, hangson the wall.   Nevzorov's irreverence surfaces in every broadcast. He relishesstirring up the town with what he calls ``sensations.'' The programconsists largely of crime reports, but also has a heavy dose of thebizarre, such as a story about the city's dirtiest toilet.   In a recent broadcast, ``600 Seconds'' took on one of the city'sbiggest department stores, accusing its employees of selling highlysought Finnish clothing under the table. The store demanded aretraction, but Nevzorov told viewers later that police hadinvestigated and that ``no excuses can be made.''   The program has stopped reporting about dogs, says producerKirill M. Shishkin, because the staff was swamped with calls fordays by people offering to adopt a canine after one broadcastreported the dog's owner had been killed in a car accident.   Nevzorov, the show's co-creator and main anchor, races aroundthis city of 4.9 million people all day to gather material for hisMonday-through-Saturday broadcast, relying heavily on tips from thepublic and police.   He has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would goalong with such status in the West _ no secretary, no privateoffice, no chauffeur-driven limousine and a salary of only $475 amonth.   Adoring fans place flowers on his car and beg for autographs.The Soviet press has praised his pioneering style, and colleaguessay he has an uncanny sense of what will excite the public.Journalism students at Moscow State University are studying hisprogram as a model of how news should be reported on television.   But Nevzorov rejects the label journalist. He is a former horsetrainer and TV scriptwriter, and bristles when the word journalistis mentioned. Most Soviet journalists, he said, could not come upwith the stories he does, and he doesn't agree with the Westernnotion that journalists should be objective and not sensationalizethe news.   He openly acknowledges that cooperatives, the fledgling privatebusinesses spawned by Gorbachev's reforms, are a target. ``Wheneverwe have the opportunity to nail them, we do,'' he says.   The public turns to ``600 Seconds'' to fight the Sovietbureaucracy. On one recent afternoon, a caller asked the program toprod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside hisapartment window.   ``600 Seconds'' and other Leningrad TV programs have helped liftthe veil from subjects such as homelessness, rape, prostitution,murder and robbery, and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject,privileges of the Soviet elite. One episode of ``Fifth Wheel,'' forinstance, complained that elaborate government homes were beingwell maintained next to a childrens hospital that was a shambles.   But there are still forbidden themes. Nevzorov's boss, AlexanderA. Yurkov, said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events arebarred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary.   Edward A. Sagalayev, head of Soviet TV's Information Department,who is fighting to reform Soviet TV, said reforms can be difficult.``I also have my bosses. We have our minister.

He has uttered those same words since Vremya first went on theair on Jan. 1, 1968, and became a main news source for the SovietUnion's 285 million people.   While other Soviet TV programs and the press are tappingglasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness, toair sensations about crime, history, or life in the West, Vremyahas remained almost as dull as it was 21 years ago.   When the superpowers agreed last March that U.S. PresidentRonald Reagan would travel to the country he had called an ``evilempire,'' a major announcement worldwide, Soviets had to sitthrough two hours of a Gorbachev speech about farming and a storyabout domestic ethnic strife before learning the news from Vremya,which is Russian for time.   Vremya still dwells on long-winded reports about the Sovieteconomy, often featuring tractors plowing farm fields and thereforedubbed ``tractor news.''   And in static pictures that make Western producers cringe,cameras often fix on Kirillov and other announcers reading lengthygovernment statements.   Vremya has its high points, however. When an earthquake killedthousands on Dec. 7 in Armenia, Vremya aired a dramatic report fromthe scene within hours and kept on top of the story for weeks.   Kirillov, 57, read the news during the ``period of stagnation,''the conservative rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev, and hascontinued through the glasnost years.   Interviewed in Vremya's tiny studio, Kirillov compared theprogram, then and now.   ``Earlier it was good,'' he said through gritted teeth,indicating some discomfort with that evaluation. Switching to hisfull baritone voice, he added: ``Now it is also good.''   Other TV programs borrow the style of American broadcasts.Kirillov concedes he watches the Cable News Network, but says he issticking to his old-fashioned, formal style.   A new man in charge of Vremya described the ideal anchorman.   ``He should be a little bit of a journalist, a little bit of anactor, a little bit of a politician,'' says Edward M.

Producers are spicing up Vremya with graphics, foreign videoplucked off communications satellites, and shorter, moreinteresting and timely reports.

But Kirillov is part of a vanishing breed. In five to 10 years,he predicts, multitalented professionals of a ``higher levelintellectually'' will replace Vremya's theatrically trainedannouncers.

But, he adds, ``Tractor news is really a tradition that we mustabandon. For decades, the impression was formed that economicinformation must occupy the top place.''   Pressure for change is coming from many directions. TheCommunist Party newspaper Pravda said in 1986 the program was dull,and TV officials agree it still is.   ``It must be more dynamic, more informative, more visual,'' saysAlexander A. Yurkov, a top official of Leningrad television,popular for its Western-style programs.   Sagalayev, who gained a reputation as a reformer when heproduced the live news and entertainment show Vzglyad, agrees andhe hopes to make Vremya more appealing.   ``News should be what interests millions of viewers, and not asmall group of people,'' he says.	</TEXT><NOTE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There are men who dress like women and women whodress like Madonna, college students whose nocturnal revelryprecludes classes before 2 p.m. Theirs is a kinky world ofacid-house music, designer drugs and sexual antics in the safe-sexera.   Manhattan dance clubs are a way of life for ``club kids'' intheir late teens and early 20s, many of them from suburbs and smalltowns where an affinity for late hours and bizarre clothes made themoutcasts.   ``It's about coming from somewhere where you're really notaccepted,'' says Katarina Markovic, 22, a would-be fashion designerand club regular from Louisville, Ohio. ``We are here because wedon't fit in somewhere else.''   ``I started out as an Ivy League student at Columbia, startedgoing to clubs and found it was more fun,'' says Jeff Bankoff, 20,an emigre from a Boston suburb who has since transferred to aless-demanding college.   Michael Alig, 21, came to New York from South Bend, Ind., toattend Fordham University. But after his introduction to the clubs,he too transferred to an easier school. Today he works as a partypromoter, earning $1,000 from club owners for each bash he throws.   He chooses his guests from 12 mailing lists of 1,500 names each,devises a theme ranging from Hawaiian luaus to televisioncommercials, hires the entertainment, orders the food and plays host.   The most outrageous parties are mentioned in the half-dozenperiodicals devoted to the club scene or in the gossip columns ofthe daily tabloids. Good press and fabulous parties provide clubswith the reputations they need to attract people who pay $15 a headto get in.   In contrast, club kids usually get in for free. The trick is todress outrageously and know the doorman _ another source of clubemployment, one that pays up to $100 for a three-hour shift.   At 1 a.m. on one winter Tuesday, yuppies, businessmen, andsedately dressed college students wait in line outside M.K., aManhattan club, as the woman working the door whisks Alig and twopals inside. Alig wears makeup, shorts made of fake fur, andsuspenders. His roommate wears a cowboy costume. With them is a19-year-old girl in a decollete black dress.   ``Those people are expedited into the clubs,'' explains FrankRoccio, who owns The World, an East Village club. ``They are thehappening people, but aside from that, they entertain as well. Wewant to look at those kids. We want to watch them cavort. Part ofthe entertainment of the evening is to go home and say, `Did you seethat guy with the blond wig and spangled eye shadow?'''   Bizarre decor and odd locales help set the clubs'anything-can-happen mood. M.K. features a wall lined with bones, andbecause it is housed in a former bank, giant vault doors open outonto the dance floor.   The hot new club Mars, which opened in January, is housed in awarehouse in Manhattan's meat-packing district at 10th Avenue and13th Street _ described by the New Yorker magazine as ``a locationthat would kill your mother if she knew where you were.'' Renovatingthe five-story building cost $1 million and the decorations includea wall of computer chipboards, a rusted piano, old television sets,and a collection of tribal masks.   At M.K., entertainment ranges from a ``performance artist'' whoseact consists of yodeling and shrieking, to a man sheathed in yardsof white tulle lying languorously on a sofa beneath a giant canvassplattered with black and white paint. He wears a woman's wig,makeup, high heels _ and nothing else.	</TEXT><NOTE>By BILL KACZOR</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The best advice to Americans abroadis to keep your hands in your pockets, lest you be gravelymisundstood.   For instance, a thumbs up might mean ``OK'' or ``right on'' toyou, but it's an obscene gesture in the Middle East.   And the ``A-okay'' sign of the forefinger and thumb in a circlecan get you into all kinds of trouble. It means money in Japan. Butin France it means you think someone is a ``zero'' and in Malta,heaven forfend, it's an invitation to have homosexual sex.   Goodness knows how they might take a ``high five.''   That's why Capt. Mike Rafferty has his hands full teaching across-cultural communications course at this Air Force base in theFlorida Panhandle. He's trying to avoid misunderstandings whenAmerican servicemen teach foreign military personnel the intricaciesof U.S. military equipment and procedures.   Just when you want to deliver a compliment to a foreign student,you might be picking a fight.   The five-day course is taught at the Air Force Special OperationsSchool. The school also offers more specific courses for personnelbeing sent to particular parts of the world such as Latin America orAfrica, but Rafferty's class gives troops an insight into culturaldifferences around the world.   For instance, patting children on the head may be a sign ofendearment to an American, but in some Asian cultures, where the topof the head is considered the home of the soul, it's an insult.   ``In most other cultures the development has been different,''Rafferty says, noting many have changed little over thousands ofyears. ``In the United States the emphasis is on individual rights.In other cultures it's the survival of the group that's important.''   This difference shows up in the classroom. IndividualisticAmericans are taught to ask questions, figure things out forthemselves and that their instructors don't know everything, saysRafferty, who hails from Stockton, Calif.   In many non-Western countries, students learn by rote and don'task questions or admit they failed to understand something becausethey don't want to be considered different from the rest of thegroup.   ``We have a saying in this country that `the squeaky wheel getsthe grease,''' Rafferty says. ``In Asia, the saying is `The nailthat stands up gets hammered down.'''   The individual competitiveness of Americans is one of the firstthings foreign students notice, Rafferty says. They often see it asa negative factor that takes away from the importance of the group.   Other countries tend to stress group competition, perhaps refinedto an ultimate by the Japanese, Rafferty says.   The group emphasis also makes the family more significant in manycountries. In the Middle East, for example, elders are respected,revered and sought out for advice.   Time and space are other important differences.   In Arabian, African and Latin American countries, arriving 30minutes or more after a meeting was scheduled to start may beconsidered ``on time,'' while in the United States it would beinsulting to show up so late, Rafferty says. On the other hand, aSwiss-German would get there early.   While Americans feel uncomfortable when others invade theirspace, many foreigners, particularly Arabs and Latin Americans, liketo get up close and personal.   When that happens to an American at a social function withforeigners he is likely to back away, but the foreigner again willclose the gap, Rafferty says.   ``There's a little dance that goes on,'' he says.   Same-sex touching also is common in the Middle East and Asia,where it has none of the sexual connotation it has in America.   Rafferty recalls a personal experience. When attending theSquadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery,Ala., he was good friends with an officer from Thailand. They playedon the same soccer team.   While dressed in their soccer shorts they were sitting in thestands and talking when the visitor reached over and put his hand onRafferty's bare thigh.   ``That was real uncomfortable for me,'' Rafferty says.``Everybody in the stands behind me was laughing, but it wasn't aproblem.''   Americans also don't like too much direct eye contact,particularly between men and women. Hispanics and Arabs, who sharesome cultural similarities because of the 700-year Moorishoccupation of Spain, like eye contact.   ``They feel they can tell a lot about an individual if they canlook into his eyes,'' Rafferty says.   Some foreigners get into trouble in the United States whenstrangers interpret their stares as a challenge, he says.   Foreigners and Americans often have stereotyped views of eachother that are untrue.   The most commonly held view of the United States is that it isthe great melting pot. As a result, some foreign visitors aresurprised when they discover exceptions to racial, ethnic and sexualequality, Rafferty says.   Often, foreigners try to bridge the gap by dressing and actinglike Americans, but that can be misleading.   ``We tend to think, `He looks like us, he must think like us,too,' '' Rafferty says. ``That's a big, big mistake.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By BOB THOMAS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America's film industry honors its own at the61st Academy Awards on Wednesday night, and it's likely that ``RainMan'' will make a big splash.   Leading the field with eight nominations, the cross-countryodyssey of two disparate brothers appears to be the favorite tocapture the best picture Oscar, with Dustin Hoffman the front-runnerfor best actor and Barry Levinson for best director.   ``Rain Man'' has the double advantage of being generally (but notunanimously) praised by the critics and embraced by the public ($122million gross in 80 days).   The other major categories look as unpredictable as a horse racefor 2-year-olds. Critics' awards have been scattered over a widefield, providing no hint as to favorites.   The uncertainty of the outcome should add excitement to Wednesdaynight's telecast, in contrast to last year's no-surprise awards. Theevent returns to the Shrine Auditorium despite the wave of protestover traffic gridlock and poor sound a year ago. The Los Angelespolice and the sound engineers have promised to do better.   The Academy also seems resolved to restore glamour to the Oscarpresentations. Producer Allan Carr (``La Cage aux Folles'') willstage the awards ``like a Broadway show,'' with Marvin Hamlischproviding the downbeat in the orchestra pit. After 17 years ofdirecting the awards, Marty Pasetta has been replaced by JeffMargolis, who has attracted good ratings with the American MusicAwards show.   The Oscarcast will have no emcee. Instead, a bevy of ``couples,companions, co-stars and compadres'' will present the awards. Amongthem: Demi Moore and Bruce Willis; Melanie Griffth and Don Johnson;Kim Novak and James Stewart; Sammy Davis Jr. and Gregory Hines;Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell; Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal; BoDerek and Dudley Moore; Kiefer and Donald Sutherland.   The nominees for best picture _ ``The Accidental Tourist,''``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Mississippi Burning,'' ``Rain Man,''``Working Girl'' _ offer a wide range of subject matter. But theyhave one thing in common: All were released last December.   This has brought renewed claims that movies released earlier inthe year have less chance of winning Hollywood's big prize. Historyseems to bear that out. Since 1934, when films became eligible on acalendar-year basis, 18 December releases have won as best picture.The tally: November, 9; October, 5; September, 4; August, 3; July, 3.   Only 11 movies released in the first six months of the year havebeen picked as the best. Interestingly, the only January release totake the top prize was the classic ``Casablanca,'' first seen in LosAngeles on Jan. 2, 1943. (For Oscar eligibility, a film must play atleast one week in an L.A. theater.)   Academy president Richard Kahn offers an explanation: ``The majorserious films are traditionally released in the last three months ofthe year. Summer is now reserved for lighthearted, escapistentertainment. That's the way movies are dealt out to the public.   ``That doesn't mean that movies released earlier in the yeardon't have a chance as best picture. `The Godfather' came out inMarch. `Annie Hall' was an April release.'' Other early releases:``The Sound of Music'' (March); ```Patton'' (February). But 11 ofthe last 17 best-picture winners were released in November orDecember.   ``There's no question that a year-end release enhances thepossibility of Oscars,'' observes publicist Booker McClay, who hasconducted campaigns for ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Out ofAfrica'' and this year's ``Gorillas in the Mist'' for UniversalPictures.   ``At the end of the year, Academy voters may have 30 pictures tosee. They are much more likely to be attracted to the new moviesthan to return to those they have seen early in the year. It's hardto generate interest in movies that were released eight or ninemonths earlier. You have to book a theater on the west side, so thefilm is available to Academy members. Meanwhile the new releases areattracting all the excitement.''   McClay cited ``E.T.'' as ``a classic example of a picture thatcame out too early. It was released in June of 1982 and unanimouslyhailed. It did fabulous business and seemed a cinch to win the Oscar.   ``But six months later, big campaigns focused on the newpictures. `Gandhi' was given an $18-million marketing budget. It washeavily screened, and everything was centered on the Gandhi theme,making it seem like something more than a spectacular film. Theresult: `E.T.' did not win.''   John Flinn, who has conducted Academy publicity campaigns for MGMand Paramount, agrees. ``It's much tougher to promote a picturereleased early in the year,'' he says. ``The December pictures haveall the ad strength and publicity behind them, and Academy membersare naturally affected.''   McClay adds: ``Studios are on the horns of a dilemma. If theyhold an important film until December, they are faced with interestcharges. If they release the picture too early, they lessen chancesof an award.''   But, given the eternal lure of the Oscar and the ego satisfactioninvolved, chances are that Academy hopefuls will continue crowdinginto Los Angeles theaters during the month of December.	</TEXT><NOTE>By BOB THOMAS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's a wretched year for predicting who willwin the Oscars, but somebody's got to do it.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Inventor Stanley Mason, who lays claim tothe world's first microwave cookware, the squeezable ketchup bottleand the granola bar, among other things, says he's seen a lot ofmillion-dollar ideas get lost because of a lack of vision incorporate America.   Like the disposable diaper he designed and the company ignored.   Mason, who's been called ``the Wizard of Weston,'' hopes to dohis part to remedy that shortsightedness with a course oncreativity he's teaching to graduate business students at theUniversity of Connecticut's Stamford campus.   The white-haired, 67-year-old inventor has a laboratory in atwo-story barn where elaborate _ and secret _ experiments are inprogress. There are blackboards and long conference tables forbrainstorming sessions.   Mason isn't trying to turn his students into Thomas Edisons, buthe does think he can impart some of his curiosity and ability tothink creatively, which he credits for the 30 patents he holds.   ``In large companies, people are divided up into departmentsthat are so insular, they don't understand what goes on in the nextoffice,'' Mason said during a recent interview at Simco Inc., theproduct development company he founded in 1973 after a corporatecareer that included stints with Hunt Foods Inc., the Glenn L.Martin Co., Armstrong Cork Co. Inc., American Can Co. and U.S.Steel Corp.   ``They don't understand the totality, the continuum, theinteraction between products and consumer. It's possible, withpatience, to teach people how to think in a creative way, how totake a tentative point of view about everything, how not to be sodamn sure about everything.''   Norman C. Parrish of Moraga, Calif., president of the NationalCongress of Inventor Organizations, calls Mason ``one of the mostwidely respected inventors'' in America.   Mason's work, he says, is ``valuable enough that Johnson &amp;Johnson and companies of that caliber give him essentially opencontracts to come up with new products for them.''   Most people make the mistake of thinking that being an inventorsimply means dreaming up a great idea, Mason says, but thesuccessful inventor is someone who recognizes the market for aproduct that doesn't yet exist, and figures out how to provide it.   ``Edison's greatest invention was not the electric light or thephonograph,'' he says. ``His greatest invention was the productdevelopment laboratory.   ``Edison was a real psychologist. He knew what could sell. Hedidn't invent things that couldn't sell. He didn't waste his time.''   Mason's 15-week course consists of a series of three-hourseminars that include lectures by successful entrepreneurs andexercises designed to stretch the students' minds.   For one recent assignment, he sent students into a Norwalk storeand told them to pick out a product that they as consumers thoughtneeded improvement. They returned to the classroom, divided up intothree companies, and spent the rest of the night playing ideas offeach other.   ``It sort of frees one's way of thinking,'' says David Chang, aresearch chemist at Clairol Inc. who is working toward his master'sin business administration. ``It will be very, very helpful topeople in technical management.''   Mason has experienced the frustrations of corporate lifefirsthand.   In the 1970s, when he developed Masonware, which he says was thefirst cookware for microwaves, Mason was told by a major Americancorporation there was no market for it. Today, such cookware is a$350 million-a-year business, he says.   When he developed the granola bar as an alternative snackproduct for Nestle S A in the 1970s, the company decided it wasn'tinterested. Quaker Oats Co. and others eventually came out withtheir own.   Then there was the disposable diaper debacle. Mason wasexasperated trying to put a square diaper on his son's round bottom_ not to mention the drudgery of laundry and those painful pricksfrom safety pins.   So when he was working for a major paper-products company, hedesigned a disposable diaper lined with soft, absorbent paper,shaped like an hourglass to fit a baby's bottom, and substitutedsticky tape for pins.   The company patented the invention and Mason got $100 for hisefforts. The company, which he didn't want to be identified, soldthe patent rights to another corporation, which also failed to acton the idea.   Since then, shaped disposable diapers have become abillion-dollar product line.   Such lack of vision helps explain why half the patents issued inAmerica last year went to inventors outside the country, Mason says.   ``Product development is a risky business,'' he says. ``There'sno security in working in product development in any U.S. companybecause if the product doesn't work, they kill the messenger.''   According to one survey, the average tenure for researchdirectors at American corporations is only 13 or 14 months, Masonsays.   ``I've worked for lots of companies _ I've been fired from lotsof companies,'' he says.   Today, Simco's clients include 40 Fortune 500 companies, such asJohnson &amp; Johnson, Kimberly-Clark Corp., Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.,Hunt-Wesson Foods Inc. and Primerica Corp.   It has a full-time staff of about eight employees, plus about125 associates, mostly academics, who provide creative input onvarious projects, such as Mason's latest venture: How to getpetroleum substitutes, including fuel, from Chinese tallow trees.   That project has been funded in part by the National ScienceFoundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state ofHawaii.   Among his other inventions: the first plastic underwire bra forPlaytex, a super-strong Velcro for Velcro Fastening Systems, aburglar alarm that hangs on a doorknob and square milk jugs thatsave shipping space.   Mason dates his first invention to his youth, when he sold aslingshot-like weapon to scores of friends. His inventive spiritwas nurtured by his father, an electrician who developed the firstelectric chair for the state of New Jersey, Mason says.   His first real job was as a teen-ager at the Trenton Free PublicLibrary, which also served as one of 12 regional depositories forpatents issued by the U.S. Patent Office. He'd spend hours poringover other people's inventions, and realized that's what he wantedto do with his life.   ``Part of what I do is feed my unconscious and conscious brainwith lots of things,'' he says. ``It's furniture you move around inyour head and the more that you have there, the more connectionstake place.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By BRIAN MURPHY</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In travel brochures and the songs ofJimmy (``Margaritaville'') Buffett, Florida is a palm-fringed havenfrom the rat race where ordinary troubles dissolve under a blazingsun.   But many newcomers are still hunting for paradise among theimpersonal sprawl of shopping plazas and traffic-cloggedthoroughfares.   ``I came here with stars in my eyes,'' says Francis Greene, a28-year-old construction equipment salesman who relocated fromPhiladelphia in September. ``I ended up with an ulcer in mystomach.''   In a state of transplants _ 780 a day by census estimates _Greene is one of the many rejections, say psychological experts andcounselors.   Recently, more attention is being paid to the malaise that canbeset Florida newcomers.   Experts say working families are confronted by demoralizingcommutes, uninviting condominium complexes and the anxiety of randomviolence in a state where cash-and-carry gun purchases are stillpossible.   Retirees, they say, can face isolation and boredom. Others simplydrop out.   ``I call it the Florida Syndrome,'' says Dr. Dean J. Rotondo,director of the neurological laboratory at Fair Oaks Hospital inDelray Beach, about 45 miles north of Miami. ``It's the reality ofFlorida versus the fantasy.''   Rotondo believes the funk is particularly strong in the 60-mileurban strip between Miami and West Palm Beach, where a nearlytwofold population boom in the past 20 years has overburdened roadsand sent developers to the fringe of the Everglades in search ofland.   Stress-related ailments, such as depression and chronic anxiety,are the most common manifestations of Florida Syndrome, saysRotondo, a native of New York City.   ``I, like many people, came here thinking that if I had a problemI would just go to the beach,'' he says. ``Well, you can only go tothe beach so much. When people come down here and find all theproblems they left behind _ and sometimes they are worse _ what'sleft is a lot of disillusionment and irritability.''   Dr. Joyce Glasser, a psychological counselor in Fort Lauderdale,says the normal stress of moving is sometimes amplified in Floridabecause relatives and friends are often left behind.   ``There's always an adjustment process after a move,'' saysGlasser, who came from Chicago in 1977. ``What we have here ispeople facing all these new ways of doing things. It hits somepeople quite hard.''   In Dr. Cesar Benarroche's counseling sessions, some newcomersfret over the crime reports of a homicide every 6.4 hours and a lackof convenient public transportation. Some are even haunted by thepeninsula's flatness and air conditioners blasting on Christmas Day.   ``You have to deal with Florida as it is, not like you imagine itshould be,'' says Benarroche, a former Yale University professor.   But accepting the urbanized Florida is particularly difficult forthe elderly, who may have toiled during their careers with visionsof an idyllic retirement in the sun, says Irwin I. Isaacs, a FortLauderdale psychologist.   What greets many retirees, he says, is domestic friction and theaura of death.   ``You have these large retirement villages and each week there'ssomeone dying,'' says Isaacs, who conducts seminars for disenchantedelders in South Florida. ``You just make a new friend and then theyare dead. It can be very disturbing.''   Isaacs, who moved to Florida from suburban Nassau County near NewYork City, says many retirees in his groups often can't cope withthe full-time presence of a spouse.   ``Here's the person you dreamt of spending your life with and allof a sudden you say, `I think I hate them,''' he says.   Still, there are some who find the warm breezes sweep them rightoff the mainstream.   Al Ackerman, 32, came to Miami from Chicago in 1984 seeking tomake a stake in the real estate market.   He now does odd jobs in the Keys and occasionally hops a sailboatto the nearby Bahamas.   ``The only Florida Syndrome I ever had was a hangover from toomuch rum,'' he said one recent afternoon in Key Largo.   He then started to hum a Jimmy Buffett tune.	</TEXT><NOTE>By CAROL J.

Youthfully ingoff protectvibrant and economically strong, West Germany has letgo of the apron strings of the United States, which gave itpolitical guidance and physical nourishment in the first hard yearsof a statehood founded on the ruins of the Third Reich.   Now engaged in a flirtation with the Kremlin that its elders inthe NATO alliance fear may be a naive or dangerous courtship, thenation has been rebelling against the familial bounds of blocdiplomacy and the burdens of a shared deGermans on both sides of the borderthat reunification is stillpossible. But West Germans concede the prospects are slim as timeheals the wound of separation and a new generation with no memoryof one Germany becomes the majority in both states.   The future holds out little hope of improvement for EastGermans. The socialist leadership of Erich Honecker has failed toembrace either the social or economic reforms championed by Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Honecker maintains that a wholesale revamping of the typeGorbachev espouses with his ``perestroika,'' or rebuilding project,is unnecessary in East Germany because of his nation's relativesuccess among the socialist states.   The 76-year-old Honecker, reported at times to be in ill healthbut showing no signs of an intent to bow out as head of theSocialist Unity Party, dismisses suggestions of a unified Germanyas an unrealistic refusal to deal with the political facts.   He has also dashed hopes that East Germany in the age ofGorbachev and glasnost might be willing to dismantle the BerlinWall that Western leaders have labeled an anachronism of the ColdWar.   Responding to appeals during a recent Vienna human rightsconference that the wall be torn down, Honecker declared it wouldstand another 50 or 100 years, as long as the differences dividingEast and West demand it.   The wall was erected in 1961 to stop the flood of East Germansseeking refuge in the West.   ``Contrary to its intention, it is daily proof that the questionit tried to answer remains unanswered,'' West German PresidentRichard von Weizsaecker has said. ``It makes the idea of belongingtogether conspicuous, an idea which it sought to make us forget.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By CAROL WOODFORD</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A tourist in search of Margaret Mitchell's rootswould have a hard time finding them 40 years after the author of``Gone With the Wind'' died in her beloved Atlanta.   Frankly, she would have liked it that way.   Miss Mitchell, known for her love of privacy, wanted herchildhood home destroyed so no one could turn it into a shrine. Herwishes were followed, and her hometown still has few physicalreminders of its most-famous writer.   The same passion for privacy was evident in August 1949, whenMiss Mitchell died after being struck by a speeding car onPeachtree Street.   Her funeral on Aug. 18 was open to 350 relatives and friends whoreceived printed invitations. It was a nine-minute service followedby a brief graveside ceremony, and the family declined flowersexcept for a blanket of blossoms that covered the top of her casket.   The author's brother, Stephens Mitchell, ``wanted to make surethe thing was held in good taste, not...some sort of circus,'' saidhis son, Gene, who now lives in Michigan.   But Atlantans, shocked by the death of the woman they knewaffectionately as Peggy, would not be denied the chance to paytheir last respects.   Crowds stood outside the funeral home, waiting with reporters inthe heat to hear the service on loudspeakers. Others stood withheads bowed as the cortege wound its way to Oakland Cemetery, whereMiss Mitchell was buried beside her parents in a grave marked witha simple marble headstone.   There had been crowds, too, at Grady Hospital, where MissMitchell lay in a coma for five days after the Aug. 11 accident.Curiosity seekers and fans descended on the hospital, and familyfriends volunteered to help answer the hundreds of telephone callsseeking news of her condition.   Nancy Wooten, a retired nurse who worked at Grady during MissMitchell's final days, recalled that the windows in her room werekept tightly closed for privacy despite the August heat and thelack of air conditioning.   ``We had to go outside to an old icehouse and bring buckets ofice in'' to help cool the room, she said.   When Miss Mitchell died on Aug. 16, at the age of 48, there weremessages of condolence from around the world.   ``The city was certainly struck by it,'' recalls CelestineSibley, a friend of the author who kept vigil at the hospital as areporter for The Atlanta Constitution. ``People felt a tremendoussense of personal loss.''   Public sentiment was strong against Hugh Dorsey Gravitt, the29-year-old off-duty taxi driver who was driving the car thatstruck Miss Mitchell. Gravitt was charged with murder, but wasconvicted of involuntary manslaughter and served less than a yearin prison.   Gravitt, now retired and living about 30 miles east of Atlantain Covington, refuses to discuss Miss Mitchell's death.   ``I paid my debt 40 years ago, but people just won't leave mealone,'' he said in a brief telephone interview.   Ms. Sibley, who still works for the Constitution as a columnist,contends that Gravitt was unfairly portrayed as a heartless killer.   ``He was the opposite _ grief-stricken,'' she says.   Miss Mitchell and her husband, John Marsh, were on their way tosee a movie the night she was injured. They were crossing PeachtreeStreet to get to the theater when Gravitt sped around a curvetoward them. Marsh stepped forward and survived, but his wife triedto make it back to the curb and was hit as Gravitt's car went intoa long skid.	</TEXT><NOTE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After hours hunched over a steering wheel,breathing bus fumes and fighting traffic, chauffeur MichaelManganaro needs to be kneaded.   For him, it's a company perk, the kind of service offered StateDepartment bureaucrats, professional hockey players, and a growingnumber of other Americans.   Manganaro and about 200 other employees of H.J. Heinz Co. cankick off their shoes and sink into a padded chair for a 15-minuterubdown once a week in a quiet conference room at the company'sdowntown headquarters.   ``Driving in the city really can tense you up,'' Manganaro, 41,says as he gets out of the chair. ``This really relaxes you. Itreally makes you feel good.''   The rubdowns are offered as part of a new stress-reductionprogram in which the company pays half of the $12.50 fee for 15minutes. It's one example of how massage is going mainstream in theUnited States.   Thousands of Americans are getting rubbed the right way at work,health clubs, hotels, malls, airports, street fairs and at home.   ``Massage is no longer perceived as illicit or a toy for the idlerich. It's for everybody,'' says Gene Arbetter, spokesman for theAmerican Massage Therapy Association. ``It's for the average worker.It's for the weekend athlete, not just an Olympian.''   The massage association estimates about 10 percent of Americanshave tried professional massage at least once. Those kneadedregularly often work in high-pressure jobs that put kinks in theirshoulders and backs.   ``The body has a good self-regulating mechanism, but we,20th-century man, throw an awful lot of obstacles into thatbalance,'' Arbetter says. ``Cradling the phone between the ear andthe shoulder, sitting in poor chairs, carrying a purse or gym bag ononly one shoulder, falling asleep in front of the television can dothings to the circulation and the muscle structure that are just notkind.''   Founded in 1943, the association's membership has jumped 500percent to about 7,500 members in the past five years. Most statesdon't license massage therapists, so the association has developed aprogram of certification that requires members to spend at least sixmonths at an approved school, including 500 hours of classroom time,Arbetter said.   The cost of a massage varies from $20 to $80 per hour, dependingon the location and the therapist's training, he says.   ``Massage doesn't cure or treat, but what it does try to do isget some type of balance in the body by loosening tight muscles andallowing tensions on the opposite sides of the body to be moreequal,'' Arbetter says.   Sabina Vidunas gives the massages at Heinz. Like most of today'spractitioners, she has distanced herself from the image of thesleazy massage parlor and refers to herself as a massage therapist,not a masseuse. She studied massage for a year at the SwedishInstitute in New York City after working as a registered nurse forfive years.   The Heinz employees remain clothed as Ms. Vidunas kneads theupper body, including scalp and hands, in a sort of mini-massagethat uses no oil.   ``Everyone is affected by a busier lifestyle,'' Ms. Vidunas says.``It's just taking 15 minutes out of your day to totally relax.''   Priscilla Grden, a secretary at the company's Heinz USA division,has scheduled at least one massage a month with Ms. Vidunas sinceApril.   ``It's just a great, great feeling,'' she says. ``It just takesaway all your tension.''   Massage is making headway in other corporate quarters. TherapistJan Robbins says she ``takes it to the people'' with her company,Corporate Stressbusters, a sort of massage delivery service in SanFrancisco's financial district, ``a hotbed of stress.''   When tense urban professionals beckon, Robbins shows up at theiroffice with the equipment: a stool, a cushion and a pair of hands.   ``You just whip out the chair and people sit down, close thephones, hit the lights, close the doors and get 15 minutes of peaceand quiet,'' Ms. Robbins says.   Robbins says most of her clients work for small companies, butsome large corporations have shown interest in her service becauseof the growing cost of stress-induced illness.   ``People are suffering from everything from headaches to heartdisease and the traditional ways of dealing with these problemsaren't working,'' Ms. Robbins says. ``The claims for mental andemotional stress are skyrocketing.''   Even in the offices of the State Department in Washington, D.C.,massage is a hit. Employees pay for the services of Bahaa Karra,whose company, Washington Health Systems, comes to the officebasement twice a week to offer massages ranging from 15 minutes for$11 to an hour for $44.   ``I'm booked full for two or three weeks in advance,'' Karrasays. ``It is not easy to get an hour massage in the StateDepartment.''   Nancy Gelman says she gives 15-minute massages in her portablechair at Jeffrey's Hair Salon in Pittsburgh, often to clients``between their manicure and their hair.''   Carol Cadman, a massage therapist for 12 years in Petaluma,Calif., teaches the technique to nurses at the University ofCalifornia at San Francisco.   ``The nurses do the real hands-on nurturing and healing work withpeople,'' says Cadman, who believes the medical field fails torecognize the value of massage.   The New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League have theirown massage therapist, who travels with the team.   ``It facilitates injury rehabilitation, and some of the playersfeel it's also preventative at times,'' says team spokesman DaveFreed. ``It helps to keep them loose and limber.''   Practitioners also are making their way into the malls. Bob Wattopened Massage Works about three years ago in a plaza in Plantation,Fla., near Fort Lauderdale.   Watt says business is so good he hopes to hire two additionaltherapists full time and expand his office to include the emptystore next door.   ``We get all kinds of people, from 12 years old to 92,'' he says.``Quite a majority of them are your average businessman down thestreet, the printer, the salesman, the car dealer, whatever.''   At the Phoenix and Dallas-Fort Worth airports, frazzled flierscan drop into the Air Vita health club for a massage.   ``It makes a layover a lot easier,'' says therapist Linda Wilson.``It's a relief to come to a place and be able to relax for a littlebit.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By CHARLES RICHARDS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America's top names in bridge credit their successat cards to a wealthy Texan's ``play for pay'' offer two decadesago.   Dallas businessman Ira Corn, himself a bridge player, got tiredof Italy dominating the world bridge championships. So, in 1968, hedealt himself a winning hand.   Corn recruited a handful of players _ Bobby Wolff, Jim Jacoby,Mike Lawrence, Bobby Goldman and Billy Eisenberg _ and offered themmodest pay if they would come to Dallas and ``work'' full time atplaying bridge and honing their games.   ``I joined them a year later,'' says Bob Hamman, now 50 and theworld's No. 1-ranked player. ``We'd play a lot of tournaments. Acomputer would deal certain hands so we could practice the typehands we needed work on.''   Corn dubbed his recruits the ``Aces.'' They were required to gothrough a training regimen as if they were professional athletes.   ``It was approached in that fashion, as a matter of fact, likean athletic team,'' Hamman says. ``The pay wasn't great. I believesingle guys got $800 a month and the married guys got $1,000. Butit wasn't bad at all.   `It was great experience, all against top-echelon players. Ithought it was terrific, getting paid to do something I liked sowell.''   A secretary recorded every play they made in their practicesessions, and the spotlight was beamed on good plays and bad alike.   In 1970, the Aces brought the United States its first worldbridge championship since 1959. They repeated in 1971.   ``In very short order, in respect to American competition, webecame professionals against amateurs,'' Hamman says.   Then, in 1971, the Aces broke up, ``and it was back to thepack,'' Hamman says.   But Corn's project had a lasting influence on the quality ofU.S. bridge.   ``That's evident if you look at the record of the players on theteam since it broke up,'' Hamman says. ``Every player became arock-solid player and became tougher mentally.''   Since the formation of the Aces in 1968, the United States senta team to the world championship only once without at least onemember of the Aces on it.   Jacoby says the standard of bridge also was improved by a wealthof literature about the game, much of it written by Aces members orinfluenced by their innovations.   Jacoby, who is a stock broker in Dallas, and Wolff writesyndicated bridge columns that appear daily in newspapersthroughout the United States. Wolff and Hamman tried unsuccessfullyto market a computer software program that bridge players could useto improve their play. They couldn't come up with anything thatcould meet their standards.   Lawrence, who now lives in Berkeley, Calif., was recognized asthe bridge author of the '70s and '80s, and a recent survey listedhim as the No. 1 bridge author today. He has written 12 books onvarious aspects of bidding, play and defense.   Lawrence also is regarded as one of the foremost instructors,traveling across the country to hold weeklong seminars for classesof 25 or more bridge players.   ``I certainly would be the first to credit Ira Corn for the factthat I am a bridge author at all, or that I ever began teachingclasses,'' Lawrence says.   In 1969, after Lawrence had been with the Aces for a year, Corntold them he was contemplating writing a bridge column and askedeach of them to write five practice bridge columns. He likedLawrence's easy, conversational style of writing and called him in.	</TEXT><NOTE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Almost 80 years after a typhoid outbreakmade officials wary of the local milk supply, the U.S. Naval Academyis still running its own dairy to put milk on the midshipmen'stables.   The cows don't graze on this picture-book campus by the SevernRiver, but down the road a few miles is the 865-acre U.S. NavalAcademy Farm which they share with Bill the Goat, the middies'long-horned mascot.   The fresh, rich milk they produce is much in evidence in KingHall, the cavernous wardroom or dining hall where the entire4,500-member brigade takes its meals. They empty nearly 2,500 of theblue-and-gold, half-gallon cartons daily.   But there haven't been any typhoid epidemics in trendy Annapolislately, so why is the academy still milking its own cows?   ``I guess tradition,'' says Todd Dander, 21, a second classmanfrom Dallas. ``That's what everything is around here _ tradition.''   Several others speculated that it was cheaper for the academy toget its milk from the source, bypassing the middleman.   But the civilians who run the $950,000-a-year farm, where theymilk 175 to 250 Holsteins and raise 250 calves, don't claim to beunderpricing the competition. They acknowledge the staff of 16 islarger than typically found on a dairy farm of similar size, butthey insist that they are only milking cows, not taxpayers.   The dairy is self-sufficient, relying on sales to theMidshipmen's Mess, not federal appropriations, says R.H. ``Pete''Peterson, who has run the farm since 1982, first as a Navylieutenant commander and, since retiring in 1984, as the civilianfarm manager.   He bristles at any suggestion the naval dairy is a white elephantor, as a recent newspaper headline suggested, a prime candidate``for the budget ax.''   And, like many great events n naval warfare, academy officialspoint out that this battle has been fought before _ and the middies'dairy won a decisive engagement.   The battle erupted in 1966 when the Department of Defense, facedwith complaints from Maryland and Virginia milk producers, suggestedshutting the dairy and selling the farm.   But the House Armed Services Committee rose to the defense of themiddies' milk supply, and determined that if the farm were sold, themoney would revert not to the U.S. Treasury, but to the Midshipmen'sstore fund, which lent $25,000 to start the dairy in Annapolis in1911. Two years later, Congress lent $155,000 to buy the property inGambrills, Md., 13 miles from the academy.   ``Some bright genius ... wants to close this dairy over atAnnapolis. This will be done over my prostrate body,'' the late Rep.L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C., the autocratic committee chairman, barkedat a hearing in October 1966.   ``We have developed a grade of milk over there that is wonderful,absolutely wonderful ...,'' declared Rivers. ``There is no reason todispose of this property, no reason on earth. It is owned by theyoung men over there.''   None of the 16 people who staff the farm is a civil servant. Allexcept a secretary live on the farm, where the workday for themilkers and herders begins before dawn.   ``Because it's not a self-owned operation where you work untilyou drop, we have more employees than a farm this size would take ina private, commercial operation,'' says Peterson, a former supplyofficer looking every bit the farmer in well-worn jeans, boots,plaid shirt and Dekalb cap.   The Midshipmen's Mess orders 1,282 gallons a day, paying $1.66for each gallon of the 2 percent butterfat milk. The dairy alsomixes orange juice, iced tea and other fruit drinks for the middies.   The blue-and-gold cartons, decorated with anchors and the NavalAcademy insigia, are stamped not with the last date of use but thedate the milk was packed, fresh from the cow, usually two daysbefore it winds up on the midshipmen's tables.   Upperclassmen talk wistfully of the milk shakes they used to getfrom the cream skimmed from the milk. Peterson says the academyrecently restored homemade ice cream to the menu.   Of a half-dozen midshipmen stopped at random as they strode thecampus pathways between classes, all but one knew the origin oftheir milk.   Ralita Hildebrand, 18, of Beaver Creek, Ohio, said, ``I knewafter plebe summer started because everybody made such a big dealabout bringing the milk cartons home for parents' weekend. All theparents wanted to take a milk carton back.''   If commercial dairy farmers once looked askance at the navalfarm, its neighbors in Anne Arundel County now welcome it as a greenbarrier against development, says Jack Merritt, the farmsuperintendent.   ``There is much more widespread and vigorous sympathy for usstaying here simply because the alternative appears to be another48,000 houses,'' says Merritt.   Jim Reeder, director of member relations for the Maryland andVirginia Milk Producers Co-operative, says the $1.66 that theacademy pays for its milk ``is probably a competitive price.''   Reeder says the dairymen would still prefer that the academy buymilk from them, ``But we haven't made any effort at all since thattime (in the 1960s) to do anything about it.''   That's just fine with the middies.   ``I always take a half-gallon up from the table,'' says KevinHarris, 19, a third classman from Alexandria, Va., who stores it inthe communal refrigerator in his company wardroom. ``They leave someout for us if we want to take it up.''   Mike Metzger, 21, a first classman from Crofton, Md., whoattended high school just down the road from the farm, says thedairy also serves another important purpose: ``We need the farm tokeep Bill the Goat there.''   The academy's long-horned mascot lives in a pen near the milkingparlor. Its fence is topped with barbed wire to thwart kidnappersfrom West Point, who often try to liberate the goat before theArmy-Navy football game.   West Point Cadet Capt. Adam Such, 22, of El Paso, Texas, whospent a semester at the Naval Academy last year and returnedrecently for a leadership conference, spoke with envy of themidshipmen's copious milk supplies.   ``The stuff we get doesn't taste as good,'' he says. ``Honestly,we don't get enough dairy products. There's ice cream here. I wouldlike to see that kind of stuff with us.''   But the West Pointer added, ``I don't know if having your ownfarm is the answer.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>BAYONNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After paying big bucks to rent a house onLong Beach Island last summer, Kathleen McKeand wasn't about tostay away from the beach simply because of the scare about medicalwaste washing up on shore.   But the Bayonne Hospital executive remembers how anxious shefelt watching her 1-year-old niece dig in the sand.   ``We went to the beach, but still you were extremely careful,''she recalls. ``You look upon digging in the sand as almost abirthright for a child, and yet you would very carefully examinewhere the baby was digging. I found myself being almost paranoidabout it.''   She wasn't alone.   The specter of medical waste wash-ups cast a long shadow overthe summer of 1988, closing choice beaches on the Jersey shore andNew York's Long Island, and creating worries even for beach-goerslike McKeand who never confronted a ``CLOSED'' sign on theirfavorite stretch of sand.   Now, with a new beach season fast approaching, governmentofficials are hoping to prevent a repeat of the nightmares of 1988with new rules on how hospitals dispose of their used needles,blood bags and other potentially infectious waste.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working to put inplace by the first day of summer a new pilot medical waste trackingprogram for New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and seven otherstates that border the Great Lakes. Even at that, the agencycautions that its new rules ``may not significantly reduce theamount of medical waste deposited on beaches.''   Federal officials doubt that the medical trash that made theheadlines _ including more than 100 bloody vials found on theshoreline behind Bayonne High School here last July _ came fromhospitals or other medical facilities covered by the new trackingsystem.   ``Let's not delude ourselves into thinking that this program isgoing to instantaneously capture all medical waste,'' says Dr. JohnMoore, deputy EPA administrator and chairman of an agency taskforce on medical waste.   The federal tracking program will cover hospitals and otherfacilities that generate 50 pounds or more per month of medicalwaste. Doctors, dentists and clinics that generate lesser amountswill have to weigh and log their medical wastes, but not fill outthe cradle-to-grave tracking forms.   None of this tracking or log-keeping will capture any of thesyringes that the nation's diabetics use at home and throw out inthe trash, or the needles that drug addicts use in the streets anddiscard down sewer grates.   ``If you think of a couple of million people a day, in theprivacy of their home, using a needle or syringe for medicalpurposes, that's a lot of needles,'' Moore says. ``Let's not deludeourselves into assuming that none of this stuff is going to findits way on some beach, somewhere, sometime.''   Experts say medical waste is part of a broader problem offloating garbage that sullies all American shores.   ``We treat medical waste no better or no worse than we treat anyother kind of solid waste,'' says Tom Super, a special assistant toMoore.   But AIDS has heightened the public's concern about the safedisposal of blood, needles and the tons of other potentiallyhazardous trash produced in abundance at health care facilities.   The EPA says that 3.2 million tons of the 160 million tons ofsolid waste generated each year in the United States is hospitalmedical waste.   But only 10 percent to 15 percent of that 3.2 million tons isregarded as potentially infectious. Into this category fall humanblood and blood products, used needles and scalpels, pathologicalwastes from surgery and autopsies, cultures and stocks ofinfectious agents and contaminated animal carcasses from researchlabs.   Most hospitals have in-house incinerators to burn such waste,rendering it harmless. The EPA estimates that 70 percent ofhospital waste is incinerated in-house, 15 percent is sterilized inautoclaves and 15 percent is transported off-site for incinerationor burial.   Apart from public repugnance at the sight of needles or bloodyvials on a beach, the EPA says, ``Several studies have shown thatmedical waste is generally less virulent than typical domesticwaste.''   ``Public health officials, including the Centers for DiseaseControl, believe the risk of contracting such diseases as AIDS fromexposure to these wastes is very low,'' the agency says. Those mostat risk are the medical personnel and sanitation workers who musthandle these wastes on the job.   Dr. James H. Sammons, executive vice president of the AmericanMedical Association, cautioned the EPA in a recent letter againstdefining ``medical waste'' too broadly. He said ``soiled diapers''were more of a threat than most of the trash that hospitals anddoctors produce.	</TEXT><NOTE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>BAYONNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Garbed in bright orange jumpsuits,oversized yellow galoshes, rubber gloves up to their elbows andpowder-blue hard hats, prisoners from New Jersey's Mountain ViewPrison were out scouring the Newark Bay shorefront on a recentmorning.   Under the watchful eye of guards and environmental officials,the 40 prisoners picked up the driftwood and debris that clung tothe shoreline like grime on a seldom-scrubbed tub.   Most of what they gathered was garden-variety trash: sodabottles, beer cans, Styrofoam cups, detergent containers, potatochip wrappers and the other detritus of a disposable society.   There were none of the syringes, bandages or bloody vials thatmade swimming a risky business at more inviting stretches of theJersey shore last summer.   ``No needles today,'' said Joseph Williams, 24, of nearby JerseyCity, serving a nine-month term for drug possession. ``I hope theyare gone. I hope it's going to be different this summer. A lot ofpeople didn't get to go anywhere last summer.''   Bill Honachefsky, a New Jersey Department of EnvironmentalProtection official leading the ``Operation Clean Shores'' project,said, ``Some of this material has been here for 75 years. We're notgoing to cure it in one year. But this is going to make adifference.''   Part of the Jersey shore's trash floats out of New York City'swaters from sewers that overflow whenever there is a heavy rain.   In Bayonne, at the bottom end of a peninsula that nearly buttsup against Staten Island, citizens blame the Fresh Kills Landfillon Staten Island, where they say the trash routinely spills out ofbarges.   In addition, overflows from sewage treatment plants and oceandumping all combine to add to the solids called ``floatables'' inthe waters around New York. Some inevitably finds its way to NewJersey's 127 miles of oceanfront, particularly during full moons orafter storms when tides run high.   To stem the floatables, state and federal officials are planninga more aggressive effort to catch the trash before it washes upanywhere. Three Army Corps of Engineers vessels that normallypatrol for driftwood around New York will be equipped withsmall-mesh nets to pick up garbage.	</TEXT><NOTE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With his bolo ties and legs bowed by kneetroubles, Daniel Hawley has the look of an aging cowboy bent onkicking up one more ruckus. That's precisely what the 64-year-oldretired pilot has in mind.   Hawley and his wife, Marsha, 51, have launched a mom-and-poppetition drive aimed at a decision by Congress to fund a newcatastrophic health insurance program for old people by taxingelderly retirees.   The petition drive has attracted 140,000 signatures from peopleirate about the new Medicare law, which will tack $800 or more ontothe annual tax bills of Hawley and other affluent retirees.   It's a grass-roots rebellion, fed by retirees' fears that ifCongress can put a special tax bite on them to pay for thesebenefits, the lawmakers will do it again and again.   The outcries have caught lawmakers by surprise. They were tryingto patch some of the cracks in Medicare that had spurred sales ofhigh-cost, low-benefit ``Medigap'' insurance policies.   They also wanted to free the aged of the worry of beingbankrupted by catastrophic medical bills without adding to thedeficit or raising taxes.   When then-President Reagan signed the legislation last July 1, henoted with pride that it ``follows the same premise as all soundinsurance programs: It will be paid for by those who are covered byits services.''   ``That's a change in attitude in this country,'' boasted Sen.Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.   The new law divides the $33 billion, five-year cost of benefitsamong the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries _ not equally, butaccording to ability to pay.   All but the poorest pay a $4-a-month premium that generates 37percent of the money needed. The other 63 percent of the costs arepicked up by a ``supplemental premium,'' or surtax, on the 40percent of Medicare beneficiaries with enough income to owe at least$150 in federal income taxes.   What seemed like fiscal prudence to Reagan and Bentsen smacked oftax tyranny to Dan Hawley and his loosely knit band of confederates.   He claims the new Medicare benefits are minuscule and the costsare steep, and he inveighs bitterly against the ``dictators'' whorailroaded ``this big caboozle'' through Congress.   ``The senior citizens of America are in the greatest fight theyhave been in since World War II, and this time it is with their ownCongress,'' said the white-haired Hawley, a one-time pile driverfrom Chicago who boasts that he ``never bent any tin'' during nearly34 years as an American Airlines pilot.   ``Congress did a marvelous job of keeping the public uninformedon the total extent of this bill. The seniors are saying, `We didnot ask for this bill. Take your benefit back. Leave us alone.'''   Each morning's mail brings another stack of letters, petitionsand a few small checks for Hawley's cause.   ``In Florida we are all hopping mad. Who was on the committeethat passed this abomination?'' wrote a Punta Gorda, Fla., man.   A Pottstown, Pa., retiree sent Hawley a copy of the note he nowsends charities informing them that until the new Medicare act isrepealed, ``all of our funds previously available for good causessuch as yours have been confiscated by the U.S. government.''   A Lake City, Mich., man complained that senior citizens are being``forced to pay for the health care of profligate drug users andAIDS victims who for any reason have gained a place on the rolls ofMedicare and Medicaid.''   ``If, indeed, this concept is the trend of the future, i.e.,`Make those who benefit, pay,' then please hasten to take us fromthe list of those who pay for child care, education, welfare, ADC,low-income housing and a myriad of other government giveawayprograms from which we receive no direct benefit,'' wrote theMichigan retiree.   In Washington, Bentsen and some of the other ``dictators'' atwhom this torrent of complaints is aimed defend their legislationand argue that many of the critics are misinformed.   Medicare remains ``the best buy in town'' for its rly or disabled beneficiaries,including the 1.6 million seniorswho will be hit with the maximum tax, Bentsen insists.   ``I hear some of these folks say, `Well, the odds are thatthey're not going to need catastrophic illness (covera33 millioneldege).' Well,that's wonderful,'' said Bentsen.   ``Well, there's only one-half a percent chance that your home'sgoing to burn down but to be prudent most of us go out and buy fireinsurance on our homes, and if we don't go out and voluntarily doit, the people that carry the mortgage insist that we do it. Andwe're delighted that we don't have to collect on it,'' he said.   ``The same thing is true in catastrophic. You would hope younever had to collect on it. But   The Hawleys began their organization last summer after reading asenior columnist's article in the Las Vegas Review-Journal andcalling a meeting at a local senior citizens' center.   Some were AARP members dissatisfied with their own organization'sstance.   AARP says it likes the catastrophic benefits, but not the waythey were financed. The organization has held its ground, despitepressure from some chapters.   Hawley has debated a top AARP executive on public television'sMacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, and squared off with AARP officials onother television and radio shows.   He isn't camera-shy. ``We are constantly talking over microphonesin an airplane,'' he explained.   While Hawley speaks of waging a David vs. Goliath struggleagainst the AARP to lobby for repeal of the catastrophic act, hedisavows any intention of trying to turn his coalition into apermanent lobbying force.   Others are using the fight over catastrophic coverage to try tosign seniors up for new organizations, and banks and securitiesfirms are using it to pitch tax-free investments.   Hawley's petition warns that the elderly could wind up footingthe bill for ``most of the medical costs of AIDS patients.'' Withthe AIDS medication AZT costing up to $10,000 a year per patient,Hawley fears that elderly people with big drug bills could getfrozen out of the program.   The prescription drug benefit has a cap so that only those withthe steepest drug bills are helped. Some 5.5 million beneficiaries _one in six _ will get Medicare reimbursement for some of their drugcosts.   But relatively few AIDS patients live long enough to get Medicare.   Some 10,000 AIDS patients receive Social Security disabilitypayments, but only 900 have been on the disability rolls for the twoyears required to qualify for Medicare, according to Social Securityspokesman Phil Gambino.   Despite its name, the Catastrophic Coverage Act makes only asmall dent in the financial problems confronting families trying topay for long-term nursing home care, which costs an average of$25,000 a year. The new Medicare law relaxes restrictions on theincome and assets an elderly person can own when a spouse needsMedicaid to help pay nursing home bills.   The uproar may make lawmakers leery of ever attempting to coverlong-term care costs under Medicare.   Horace B. Deets, the AARP's executive director, said thecomplaints about the Medicare catastrophic act are a ``good exampleof what happens when you take a patchwork approach to a systemicproblem. We need something done for universal access tocomprehensive care, and it isn't here yet for everybody.''   In addition to repealing the catastrophic act, Hawley also wantsCongress to set up a blue-ribbon presidential commission to examinethe ``monstrous'' unresolved health care issues. He would set onerule for this commission: no politicians allowed.   Hawley isn't saying when he will deliver his petitions toCongress.   ``Eisenhower didn't tell the Germans when he was going to land,''the pilot said. ``When the snowball is rolling down the mountain,you don't stop it halfway.''   If he loses the fight, ``then I almost guarantee you that in twoyears, Congress has its greatest turnover ever. The senior powerwill vote them out of office.''   If he wins, ``then you will never hear Daniel Hawley's nameagain. He's going down and start playing golf, all across thiscountry.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The unusual story behind the founding of RegisHigh School is captured in the Latin words engraved in stone abovethe columns on its classical facade: ``Deo et Patriae PietasChristiana Erexit.''   Or, as even the most plodding of Latin scholars who ever trodthe corridors of this reknowned Jesuit high school might translate:``Built by Christian piety for God and country.''   Seventy-five years after a rich widow anonymously gave herpastor $500,000 to build a free school for Catholic boys, Regis isstill giving full scholarships to every student it admits.   It draws the cream of the academic crop, mainly from parochialgrammar schools in the five boroughs of New York, the surroundingthree-state suburbs and sometimes even farther afield.   ``Everyone thinks I'm crazy to come into the city,'' says MarkMazzetti, 14, a freshman who spends three hours a day travelingback and forth from Princeton, N.J.   For Luis Taveras, 17, a senior who chose Regis over the BronxHigh School of Science, the trip to school is a 30-minute subwayride from the Bronx.   ``I love it here,'' Taveras says. ``When you come from theBronx, it's really challenging to grow up in a different kind ofworld. This school is a meeting ground for people from so manydifferent backgrounds.''   Today's 501 Regis students are getting their free education _valued by school officials at over $24,000 _ thanks not only to thegenerosity of the original benefactor and her family who over theyears gave millions to keep the school running, but its 7,500alumni who in recent years have become major benefactors in theirown right.   About half the $3.3 million budget comes from interest on theschool's investments. The rest is raised each year from alumni,foundations and other sources.   ``Each year the costs go up at least $200,000,'' says the Rev.James J. Fischer, S.J., the president since 1980. ``That's notgoing to end.'   But while other Catholic schools struggle with rising tuitionsand contracting enrollments, Regis has been able to pour $5 millionin recent years into expanding science labs and other majorrenovations of its building on East 84th Street, two blocks fromCentral Park.

Or, as even the most plodding of Latin scholars who ever trodthe corridors of this reknowned Jesuit high school might translate:``Built by Christian piety for God and country.''   Seventy-five years after a rich widow anonymously gave herpastor $500,000 to build a free school for Catholic boys, Regis isstill giving full scholarships to every student it admits.   It draws the cream of the academic crop, mainly from parochialgrammar schools in the five boroughs of New York, the surroundingthree-state suburbs and sometimes even farther afield.   ``Everyone thinks I'm crazy to come into the city,'' says MarkMazzetti, 14, a freshman who spends three hours a day travelingback and forth from Princeton, N.J.   ``My friends back home think I live here,'' says Marty Cassidy,14, a freshman who rises at 5:30 a.m. to commute with his brother,a sophomore, from New Canaan, Conn.   ``The journey can take up to two hours each way, but I don'thave any regrets. You can do a lot of homework on the train _ oryou can just sleep.''   For Luis Taveras, 17, a senior who chose Regis over the BronxHigh School of Science, the trip to school is a 30-minute subwayride from the Bronx.   ``I love it here,'' Taveras says. ``When you come from theBronx, it's really challenging to grow up in a different kind ofworld. This school is a meeting ground for people from so manydifferent backgrounds.''   Today's 501 Regis students are getting their free education _valued by school officials at over $24,000 _ thanks not only to thegenerosity of the original benefactor and her family who over theyears gave millions to keep the school running, but its 7,500alumni who in recent years have become major benefactors in theirown right.   About half the $3.3 million budget comes from interest on theschool's investments. The rest is raised each year from alumni,foundations and other sources.   ``Each year the costs go up at least $200,000,'' says the Rev.James J. Fischer, S.J., the president since 1980. ``That's notgoing to end.'   But while other Catholic schools struggle with rising tuitionsand contracting enrollments, Regis has been able to pour $5 millionin recent years into expanding science labs and other majorrenovations of its building on East 84th Street, two blocks fromCentral Park.

Hevern, S.J., the school psychologist.

Her blood pressure also was high, so high that the obstetricianasked the nurse who called him to repeat the figures.   ``I didn't think I'd heard what I heard,'' Burditt recalls.   There was no mistake. Rosa Rivera's blood pressure was 210 over130 _ higher than any Burditt had seen in 12 years of deliveringbabies in this South Texas city.   In one respect, Rosa Rivera was not unusual at all. Poorpregnant women frequently come to DeTar to give birth withouthaving seen a doctor before.   She ``sounds like more than I can handle,'' said Burditt, chiefof the private hospital's obstetrical department. He asked nurseTammy Kotsur to arrange for an ambulance to transport the woman toJohn Sealy Hospital in Galveston, 160 miles away.   Kotsur put him on hold, turned to her supervisor, Donna Kiening,and said, ``He wants to transfer her. What should I tell him?''   ``Tell him you've got to check on a few things,'' said Kiening,a by-the-rulebook nurse who had recently become the supervisor ofthe OB-GYN department.   So began a case that eventually would land a doctor in troublewith Washington and force a new look at an old question: Whenshould the government second-guess a doctor's judgment in treatingpatients.   The nurses were uneasy because of a new, federal anti-patientdumping law that was part of something called COBRA, theConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.   Hospitals cannot turn away patients needing emergency care or inactive labor.   A case could be made that Rosa Rivera qualified on both counts.   About 2{ hours after arriving at DeTar and after some heatedwords between Burditt and the nurses, Rosa Rivera left the hospitalin an ambulance. She had her baby a half-hour later in theambulance by the side of the road.   Mrs. Rivera and her son survived the Dec. 5, 1986, ordeal.   But DeTar Hospital nearly lost its eligibility for Medicarefunding and Michael Burditt became the first doctor prosecutedunder the patient dumping law.   DeTar paid a $5,000 fine, but Burditt refused to pay the $25,000he was assessed. The Texas and American Medical Associations tookhis side, and he is now awaiting the verdict of a Health and HumanServices administrative law judge, expected in July.   Some 35 million Americans lack health insurance. According tosome estimates, as many as 250,000 patients are batted fromhospital to hospital each year because they can't pay the bills.   The following account is drawn from interviews with Burditt,Mrs. Rivera and others, as well as the 961-page transcript of thefour-day hearing held in late January in the case of the InspectorGeneral vs. Michael L. Burditt.	</TEXT><NOTE>By COLLEEN BARRY</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Becky and Mimbo have the sameproblems as many infertile couples, but theirs have greaterramifications: They represent a possible threat to their species.   Infertility among aging, wildborn gorillas prompted specialiststo adapt a human artificial fertilization technique for use onBecky, a lowland gorilla at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in ColoradoSprings.   ``The hope is to have a diverse genetic pool so the gorillasdon't become inbred, by managing the population to the maximumgenetic representation of all captive gorillas,'' says Dr. PaulCalle, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo veterinarian.   ``If three of 10 gorillas are responsible for 80 percent of theoffspring, the contribution of the others get lost over time.''   Estimates by experts on the wild gorilla population range from10,000 to 70,000.   Only 15 percent to 20 percent of the 297 captive gorillas inNorth America are wildborn, or of the foundation stock for carryingon the bloodline. Experts say many of them are reaching the end oftheir reproductive years.   Such is the case with Becky, 32, and Mimbo, 26, who have just onesurviving offspring.   The Denver and Cheyenne Mountain zoos are working under atwo-year grant from the Institute of Museum Services. LastSeptember, they assembled a team including zoo veterinarians, aninfertility specialist and a reproductive physiologist to performGamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) on Becky. It was the firstreproductive procedure ever tried on a gorilla, according to Dr.Richard Cambre, a Denver Zoo veterinarian.   Becky did not become pregnant, but the surgery did provideinformation on the gorilla's reproductive system that could increasethe chances for success when she undergoes the procedure again.   Similarities in the reproductive systems of humans and gorillasmake gorillas likely candidates for artificial fertilizationtechniques such as GIFT, says Dr. William Yee, a University ofCalifornia at Irvine infertility specialist who performed Becky'ssurgery.   ``We learned that, like in humans, gorillas responddifferently,'' Yee says. ``It seemed (Becky's) eggs were not matureenough.   ``In the normal process of reproduction, after the egg isreleased, the Fallopian tube picks up the egg from the ovary. Insidethe Fallopian tube is where fertilization occurs.   ``With Gamete IntraFallopian Transfer, we're placing the eggs andsperm inside the tube so when we're finished, we're assured the eggand sperm are present in the spot where fertilization occurs.''   GIFT has a live birthrate of 25 percent among women, comparedwith 17 percent with in-vitro fertilization, he says.   Similar efforts have been made at the Dallas Zoo, where threegorillas have undergone unsuccessful reproductive surgeriesfollowing Becky's, says Naida Loskutoff, a Ph.D. candidate at TexasA&amp;M who participated in Becky's procedure.   Eggs were collected for future artificial inseminations from a32-year-old and a 17-year-old physically unable to bear offspring.The third, like Becky an infertile female in her 30s, wasartifically inseminated, Loskutoff says.   Conservationists find the prospect of apparently infertilegorillas producing offspring encouraging for the species' future.   In cases where a species exists only in captivity, often becauseof habitat destruction, zoos have crossed the line fromentertainment to conservation to ensure the species' survival,Cambre says.   The goal in such cases is to return the species to the wild oncesurvival can be ensured, he says.   Their numbers don't place lowland gorillas among the mostendangered species, but they are among the biggest draws to zoos.Experts say their popularity has increased since the recent film,``Gorillas in the Mist,'' which depicts Dian Fossey's work with themore severely endangered mountain gorilla.   ``If you sit and watch a family of gorillas, you see a littleinsight to human behavior,'' says Lester Fisher, coordinator of theSpecies Survival Plan gorilla committee based at Chicago's LincolnPark Zoo.   Natural breeding among captive gorilla groups is preferred oversurgical procedures, and Fisher says the natural method is provingincreasingly successful, especially among larger zoo populations.   ``Our breeding program in our North American SSP has definitelyturned the corner,'' Fisher says.   To that end, the SSP committee for lowland gorillas documents thefamily trees of captive gorillas in North America and monitorsinter-zoo transfers of the animals to avoid inbreeding and thesubsequent loss of genetic diversity.   ``Genetic diversity means the animals carry a variety of genes,representing a cross-section of the population,'' Fisher says. ``Inthe wild, if you have normal groups, you would have total geneticdiversity.   ``Since we are no longer taking the animal from the wild, we aredealing with a captive population and we have to look at a biggerpicture so we can look specifically at the problems of managinghusbandry and reproduction.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lisbon, a charming but dilapidatedcoastal city of seven hills, looks more like a teeming Third Worldmetropolis than the modern European capital it is.   There are the sloping terra-cotta roofs, the palm trees, thewell-used park benches and ugly modern monuments. Shoeshine men workon the black-and-white tiled sidewalks and pedestrians dart throughhonking, fume-spewing traffic. The people look sturdy, and notparticularly fashion-minded.   This scene underscores how far Portugal, perched on thesouthwestern fringe of Europe, has to go to achieve its goal ofcatching up with its neighbors. Now an overheating economy isfurther imperiling that ambition.   A surging inflation rate and trade deficit could hamper the smallcountry's ability to expand and modernize in readiness for 1992.That's when the 12-nation European Community, which Portugal joinedin 1986, becomes one barrier-free marketplace of 320 millionconsumers.   In the late 1980s, Portugal is belatedly turning its attentioneastward to the rest of Europe after hundreds of years of lookingacross the Atlantic and into Africa and India.   The 10.3 million Portuguese, descended of Celtic, Roman andMoorish conquerors, perhaps have come to terms with the loss of theglobe-circling empire that their famous explorers discovered fivecenturies ago.   Portugal's colonial legacy is still evident in the relaxedmingling of black, brown and white faces in Lisbon's cafes, in thecurry in Portuguese food, in the easy command of English in thisPortuguese-speaking country.   After painful recession, austerity and more than 25 percentinflation in 1983 and 1984, Portugal is one of Europe's most dynamiceconomies. Gross domestic product has grown 4.5 percent a year onaverage for three years, and is projected to continue at 3.5percent. Unemployment has been halved to nearly 6 percent.   A conscientious debt-repayer, Portugal has cut its foreign debtto $16 billion, down from 80.4 percent of GDP in 1985 to 40.7percent.   But signs of economic overheating appeared last year, forcingunpopular measures. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva'scenter-right Social Democrats, who won an unprecedented majority inparliament in the June 1987 general election, have lost support inrecent months.   A poll recently published in O Jornal showed that the SocialDemocrats down to 41 percent nearly halfway through their four-yearterm from just under 50 percent in the election. The clean-cut,49-year-old prime minister has developed a reputation for beingabrasive and overly self-confident.   The opposition Socialists, meanwhile, have gained to 36 percentfrom 22.3 percent, and Socialist President Mario Soares, alegendary, consummate politician, has become increasingly popular.   Nonetheless, Cavaco Silva is still expected to be the firstPortuguese leader to survive a full four-year term since the 1974Revolution of the Carnations which ended 48 years of authoritarianrule, mostly under rightist dictator Antonio Salazar.   ``We are making our way firmly forward toward a more efficientand competitive economy, a more creative and enterprising society, afreer, more modern country, without being perturbed by those whowould like Portugal to turn back to the past,'' the prime ministersaid in a recent speech.   The most prominent opponents of modernization are farm workerswho are resisting the planting of eucalyptus trees for paper pulpprocessing, fearing these will replace traditional olive trees andthreaten farm jobs.   The eucalyptus war reached a climax in late March when localpeople trying to dig up newly planted trees in Valpacos clashed withnational guardsmen.   In Lisbon, there are plenty of complaints, too.   Jaime de Lacerda, director of the Confederation of PortugueseIndustry, said, ``Now people tend to criticize the government a lotand the mood is a very critical one.''   Said economist Jose Cavalheira Antunes of Banco Espirito Santo,``I think we have a certain situation of crisis.''   You hear it on the streets.   Isaac da Silva, a 52-year-old taxi driver, said, ``Many peopleare unhappy because life isn't easy. We have to work very hard. Thecost of living is very hard.''   But not everybody is negative.   Licelia Godinho, a 35-year-old car rental worker, said, ``Thereare more jobs. There is less poverty in particular than in the otherdays.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Spain is discovering the price of progress.   The Iberian country of 38.8 million people and 196,000 squaremiles has transformed itself into a confident, Western democracysince Generalissimo Francisco Franco's crippling 36-yeardictatorship.   Today, Spain is Europe's star economic performer, eagerlymarching toward 1992, when the Common Market nations' internal tradebarriers are to fall.   But there are signs of economic overheating and a new feeling ofpolitical uncertainty as Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalezfaces challenges from left and right.   Spain's new prosperity isn't felt by all, and there are worriesthat the benefits of its economic transformation _ prosperity,confidence, optimism _ are being accompanied by less favorablechanges. This is prompting some soul-searching questions amongSpaniards about the young democracy's direction.   In the rush to modernize, Spaniards are polluting theirenvironment. Crime, much of it drug-related, is on the rise, and inthe capital women clutch their purses to prevent their snatching.   But overriding the misgivings is a tremendous sense of vitality,what some are calling a gold-rush feeling, as 1992 approaches.   ``In one generation, you had people very scared about what wasgoing to happen to their futures and now I think there is a lot moreoptimism,'' says Jorge Hay, a director of Banco Hispano Americano.   For four years, growth has been spurred by low oil prices, strongglobal economic expansion, agreed low wages, tight money andrestructuring to broaden the economic base. Major industries aretextiles, shoes, agriculture, tourism, cars, ships, machinery andsteel.   ``We have in process an extraordinary acceleration ofmodernization,'' Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga said in a recentspeech. ``The economy really has strong momentum.''   Spain's economy is expected to be Europe's fastest-growing thisyear with a 4.5 percent growth rate, after about 5 percent in thelast two years.   Spain has come a long way from the old stereotype images ofFlamenco dancers and bullfights. Madrid has become a prosperous,almost antiseptic-looking European capital.   The fashion statement in the city today is black. The well-to-doSpanish are a graceful, well-groomed people who like to be admired.The long lunch, which begins after 2 p.m., is an enduring tradition.Menus list an astonishing array of seafood.   Once strongly Catholic, Spain has become increasingly secular.The birth rate has fallen dramatically, to 1.5 children for everywoman from 2.8 in 1975. Divorce was legalized 10 years ago, abortionin 1985. Young couples display a physical affection unheard of underFranco.   Another tradition that endures is the ``macho'' society.   Few women hold positions of any power, and only one-third work,the lowest rate in the Common Market. Families remainmale-dominated, although, incongruously, Spanish women have alwayskept their maiden names and children are given both their parentssurnames.   Spain's 1977 transition from isolationist dictatorship todemocracy was relatively smooth.   Franco, who came into power after the 1936-1939 civil war thatclaimed a million lives, died in 1975. His chosen successor, KingJuan Carlos I, facilitated the creation of a new constitution. Therestored monarch and his family remain highly popular.   The constitution established 17 autonomous Spanish regions, somewith their own language besides the official Castilian. Regionaldifferences are most starkly illustrated by the 21-year Basqueseparatist campaign, which has claimed more than 600 lives.   Confidence in Spain's democracy was bolstered by the failure of a1981 military coup, and Gonzalez was elected in 1982, backed bySpain's most prominent union, the General Workers Union.   Re-elected in 1986, Gonzalez must call the next election by June1990, and not so long ago he seemed invincible. Now many Spaniardsare convinced the former lawyer will win, but that his Socialistparty will lose its parliamentary majority.   The factious right has gotten more organized while 47-year-oldGonzalez has clashed on the left with his main trade union ally,General Workers Union chief Nicolas Redondo. Redondo supports thedrive for growth, but believes the wealth should be more widelyspread.   Gonzalez' determination to dismantle Spain's tradition oflifetime employment is unpopular. His relations with the unionssoured further when the 3 percent inflation forecast used tonegotiate wages agreement turned out to be way off the mark of 5.8percent.	</TEXT><NOTE>By DAN SEWELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Xavier Suarez gained national attention when he waselected as Miami's first Cuban-born mayor. Around here he quicklygained a reputation as the ``pothole mayor,'' competent but dull inthe land of ``Miami Vice.''   He was considered by many to be an unimaginative technocrat,seemingly uncomfortable in public and lacking the urbane,high-profile style of his predecessor.   Suarez steered away from the foreign policy issues that oftendominate the local news media, saying his job was not to overthrowFidel Castro but to get the garbage picked up.   That was four years ago. No one calls Xavier Suarez boringanymore.   From a $5,000-a-year job which carries no actual executive powersbecause Miami has a city manager system, Suarez has built apolitical empire.   His influence has spread from Dade County to the state capitaland Washington, as well as to Latin America.   With the departure of San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros frompolitics because of personal problems, Suarez is one of thehighest-profile Hispanic politicians in the United States.   Re-elected in 1987 with 62 percent of the vote, Suarez last yearwas under serious consideration to become Secretary of Housing andUrban Development. This year he was the only mayor in the WhiteHouse team of observers sent to monitor the elections in Panama. Heoften meets with Latin heads of state and travels to Latin countriesas a speaker.   Suarez also claimed national attention for his personalized rolein trying to ease the Overtown race riots in January.   In a poll conducted by a veteran Democratic consultant inFebruary, Suarez got 76 percent overall approval ratings fromMiami's three major ethnic groups _ blacks, Hispanics and ``Anglos.''   ``He's close to unbeatable,'' says Raul Masvidal, the bankerdefeated by Suarez in 1985.   Still officially independent, Suarez has allies in both majorparties.   With all this political clout, what's next for Xavier Suarez?   ``A U.S. Senate seat would always be interesting,'' Suarez says.``A high-level administration position. It would take a pretty highlevel to get me out of here. Someday, governor. To manage a $23billion budget and do it efficiently would be challenging.''   Suarez has an easy explanation for how he moved so far soquickly: He's still at heart a pothole mayor interested inefficiency, and he's learned that the most efficient way to getthings done is with political networking and pressure.   ``I used to say: `I'd rather beg forgiveness than askpermission.' It seemed better to let everybody else follow. Now Ihave found that it's a lot easier to have people agree with you. Youget things done a lot quicker.''   Also, he has found he has more of a taste for politics than herealized.   He learned that his own popularity is a commodity with valuebeyond getting him re-elected easily and enabling him to dream ofstatewide office.   ``If you have good ratings in the polls, you're in a position tonegotiate with both parties,'' Suarez says. ``You can exert a lot ofinfluence, but you have to win a lot.''   Suarez, a Villanova-trained engineer, Harvard-educated lawyer,had lost three city elections before 1985. He and his associatesaren't losing many these days.   In 1987, Suarez backed the opponent of his chief nemesis on thecity commission, fiery anti-Communist Joe Carollo. The son of anuclear physicist imprisoned by Castro, Suarez said it was time toget city meetings away from exile politics and onto current concerns.   Suarez built a coalition on the city commission after Carollo wasousted. That enabled him, The Miami Herald reported, to go throughthe two city commission meetings in January without losing on asingle one of the more than 100 votes in each meeting.   Last year, Suarez backed candidates who ousted three countycommissioners who had a total 44 years in office among them. He alsobacked several judges, legislators, and cabinet officials in theirsuccessful election campaigns.	</TEXT><NOTE>By DARREN DOPP</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WEST VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   All is not as it seems in this wooded,idyllic slice of the Allegheny Mountains known as the EnchantedHills.   True, the Cattaraugus Creek still snakes through sylvan glades ofthe Zoar Valley as it has for centuries, cutting a 200-foot gorgethat enthralls the trout fisherman and thrills the whitewater rafter.   But less than a mile away, a cluster of white buildingssurrounded by barbed wire marks the site of some of the most highlyconcentrated radioactive waste in the world, stored in a massiveunderground tank.   If released into the environment, the resulting radiation fromthe corrosive, near-boiling liquid would make the scenic areauninhabitable for almost as long as it took to make the gorge. It isthe legacy of a former nuclear fuel reprocessing operation.   That ominous distinction has made West Valley, 35 miles south ofBuffalo, the scene of the nation's first large-scale attempt to tryout radioactive waste treatment technology.   The principles tested here are expected to be used in stabilizingsimilar wastes at federal installations in Savannah River, Ga. andHanford, Wash., both of which have significantly greater amounts ofradioactive wastes.   ``We're proving that the nation can deal with nuclear wastessafely and effectively,'' says Willis Bixby, the Department ofEnergy's project director.   Many environmentalists disagree, however, pointing out thatmodern science does not yet know how to render radioactive wasteharmless.   The goal of the $700 million project is to get the liquid wastesout of the aging tank and into a more stable form.   Although other countries, such as France, which relies on nuclearpower for 70 percent of its energy needs, have been using thetechnology for 20 years, the United States has simply stockpiled itsnuclear wastes until now.   West Valley was the nation's only commercial reprocessingfacility. During the late '60s and early '70s, it took in spent fuelfrom nuclear power plants around the country and extracted usableuranium and plutonium. The byproduct of the process was some 600,000gallons of waste.   When it was built in the mid-1960s, New York Gov. NelsonRockefeller saw the facility as an opportunity for the state to getin on the development of a technology that promised to solve thenation's energy needs. He envisioned a massive nuclear complex thatwould include reactors and research facilities.   But that promise all but disappeared a few years later asdeclining markets, tougher federal regulations and the radiationhazards to workers forced the facility, run by Getty Oil Co., toclose.   It was inoperative from 1972 until 1982 when the federalDepartment of Energy began the West Valley Demonstration Project, amultimillion-dollar cleanup effort.   The first step in a complicated process that has taken years toset up is to filter the liquid waste through columns filled withzeolite, a sandy clay. The filtering reduces the radioactivity ofthe liquid by 99 percent. The liquid is then blended with cement andpoured into 71-gallon steel drums. Officials expect to produce some15,000 of the drums, each weighing 1,000 pounds, by 1994.   The remaining, concentrated zeolite wastes are to be transformedinto 300 glass logs. The 10-foot logs will eventually be shipped toa federal repository for high-level wastes scheduled to be opened inNevada in the year 2003. Until then, the glass logs are being kepton the site.   West Valley Nuclear Services Co., a Westinghouse Electric Co.subsidiary handling the project, activated the treatment systemslast spring with some 500 people involved in operations. Inside thewhite buildings, technicians in green jump suits with metersattached to their collars to measure their exposure to radiation useremote controls to pump the wastes through filters andsolidification processes.   Except for an incident in 1986, when 11 construction workers werecontaminated after passing around a contaminated tool, there havebeen no major problems at the facility. All but one of the workerswere back on the job several hours later.   Project director Bixby thinks the safety record will contributeto greater public acceptance of the nuclear power industry.   ``We can't make up for the negative publicity of Three MileIsland and Chernobyl,'' he says. ``But we can be a positive factorwhen people consider the risks of energy sources and begin tore-evaluate nuclear energy.''   Increasing attention to the wastes produced by combustible fuelsand the so-called greenhouse effect and acid rain will lead peopleto reconsider nuclear power, he said.   Local environmental activists, however, say the project willprove otherwise.   ``It's impressive what they are doing, but it's no solution,''says Carol Mongerson, a member of the Coalition on West ValleyNuclear Waste. ``All we've really done is change it from one form toanother.''   Mongerson says solidified radioactive waste remains harmful forthousands of years. A single glass log will give off some 8,500rems, enough radiation to kill a person exposed only for a fewminutes.   The coalition sued the state and federal governments to forceWestinghouse to conduct an environmental impact study of its plansto hold cement drums in a vault at the site. A federal judge ruledthat until the study is completed, the company must store the drumsin a temporary facility.   Mongerson says West Valley officials are engaging in a lot of``wishful thinking'' about the future of the nuclear industry.   ``There really isn't any feasible way of dealing with thebyproducts,'' she says.   Meanwhile, life in the nearby farming community life proceedsundaunted, with residents scoffing at suggestions of a catastrophicaccident at the site.   ``Heck, we're the ones who make up those glow-in-dark jokes,''says Bernard ``Bud'' Williams, supervisor of the town of 2,000people.	</TEXT><NOTE>By DAVID BAUDER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>TICONDEROGA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   John Wright has never forgiven police inthis historic Adirondack community for their role in sending him toprison for two years in the 1960s.   But he didn't just get mad. He got even. He got more than even.   The 61-year-old self-taught lawyer sued to get six members of thenine-member police force, including the chief, fired because theyweren't trained and tested properly.   The town fought him every step of the way, but finally gave upthis year when New York state's top court ruled they were wrong andWright was right.   The police chief became a former police chief.   ``Twenty years ago I would have gone out and knocked these guyssilly with my fists,'' says Wright, who lives and works out of twotrailers around the corner from the site of a famous RevolutionaryWar battle. ``Now I just take the lawbooks and get them that way.It's better.''   His neighbors in Ticonderoga are amazed _ not to mention annoyed_ at how far Wright carries a grudge.   His story began in 1963. Strapped for a job, he came to theAdirondacks from New Jersey to work at a bar owned by his mother. Hesaid people in the rugged mountain area, naturally suspicious ofoutsiders, were ``out to get me'' from the start.   About two years after Wright moved in, Horace Snow, then a statepolice officer, and his colleagues raided the bar and arrestedWright for possession of an unlicensed gun. Wright didn't disputethe charge, although he considered his sentence of 3{ to 7 yearsexcessive.   During Wright's ``2 years, 2 months and 28 days'' in prison, hismother's tavern burned to the ground in a mysterious fire that wasnever solved, he says.   Once out of prison, Wright worked in an auto parts store andmaintained an uneasy truce with police. He continued an interest inlaw that began with a correspondence course in prison, takingclasses at Adirondack Community College.   The auto parts job didn't work out. Wright, whose wife is aschool cook, raised money by renting out other trailers on hiscluttered property. In 1981, Wright fought with a tenant who didn'tpay her phone bill, holding the woman's stereo and television sethostage until he got his money.   He also got arrested on grand larceny and possession of stolenproperty charges. Although the charges were eventually dropped,Wright didn't forget.   Instead, the amateur lawyer retreated to his second trailer,stuffed with hundreds of second-hand lawbooks and a home computer.   By then Snow, retired from the state police, was chief of thesmall police force in this community of 5,500 people on the northernedge of Lake George. Studying laws and personnel records, Wrightnoticed that Snow didn't have two years of supervisory experienceand didn't take a civil service examination _ both required ofprospective police chiefs by state law. He said Ticonderoga alsodidn't properly advertise the position when the job opened.   Wright also discovered that the town's three part-time policeofficers and two full-time constables hadn't taken required civilservice examinations before they were hired.   So, he sued.   A state trial court in Essex County agreed that the threepart-time police officers should be fired. But the court said Snowand the other two officers could stay on.   Town officials fired the three officers, then quickly rehiredthem as constables. Wright filed an appeal.	</TEXT><NOTE>By DAVID ROCKS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WADSWORTH, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The prairie marshes, ponds and streamsnear this town just north of Chicago would look familiar to theEuropeans who first settled northern Illinois 150 years ago.   But the wetlands today are being fed by a maze of undergroundpipes with the flow of water from the Des Plaines River regulatedby a computer.   It's part of a $10-million project to help scientists betterunderstand wetlands. Researchers worldwide are watching, becausethe work could become a model for similar projects to restore vitalmarshes and swamps.   ``We're aiming for a natural prairie landscape, so when you lookacross it you will see what the early explorers would have seen,''says Donald Hey, who heads the 450-acre Des Plaines River WetlandsDemonstration Project.   ``Most of what we're doing is trying to compensate for the lossof landscape through the introduction of concrete and controls,''says Hey, director of Wetlands Research Inc., a non-profit groupfunded by corporate and government grants.   Nationwide, more than half the 200 million acres of wetlandsthat existed when European settlers arrived on the continent havedisappeared. They continue to be destroyed at an annual rate of275,000 acres, or more than one-third the area of Rhode Island,according to figures compiled by the federal Fish and WildlifeService.   Wetlands _ marshes, swamps and bayous _ can soak up flood watersand help improve water quality, many conservationists say.   ``One of the key values of wetlands is they serve as a kind of afilter _ some people might call it a kidney _ within an aquaticsystem,'' says David Davis, director of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency's wetlands protection program.   ``We need to be finding ways to restore areas that have beendegraded,'' Davis said in a telephone interview from Washington.   He said the Des Plaines project probably will be examined aroundthe country as a model for other projects spurred by increasedawareness of wetlands and their benefits.   The 3-mile stretch of the Des Plaines River, about an hour'sdrive north of Chicago's Loop, will in the next few years berestored to the kind of flora and fauna that inhabited the sitebefore settlers drained it for farming in the 1850s.   ``We're reversing a 130-year trend,'' Hey says. ``We're takingout a lot of vegetation that is ecologically out of place.''   Much of the vegetation that had overtaken the natural plantsduring the last century-and-a-half has been cleared. That hasinvolved bulldozing the land so it more resembles its naturalcontour, and taking out many of the trees that settlers had planted.   ``It was choked _ it was overgrown with trees when we started,''Hey says. ``I've been amazed that there hasn't been more outcryover the cutting of the trees.''   Where the project has been completed, the bullrush marshes arepeppered with highlands of oak, making the site a texturedpatchwork of browns and greys. Since the beginning of the spring,it has begun to turn various shades of green and migratory birdshave returned to roost.   Hey hopes to see more of the osprey, heron and bufflehead duck,as well as fox and beaver that have already begun to repopulate thearea.   ``It's amazing the change we've had in waterfowl,'' Hey says.``The more we open up the land, the more we'll see the waterfowlcoming back.''   The site looks like a nature preserve, but with numerousconduits, pumps and monitoring stations hooked up to an on-sitecomputer, the project is also a laboratory for experimenting withvarious aspects of wetlands management.   ``One of the things that is particularly interesting about theproject is that it combines both wetlands restoration and appliedresearch,'' says Davis of the EPA. ``It's kind of a livinglaboratory.''   Hey says the project will explore what water depths, soils andplant types are most effective in improving water quality, how longto retain the water, and what kinds of other elements are needed inthe system.   So far, with only $5 million of the $10 million price tag forthe project raised, Hey and his colleagues have built fourexperimental wetland areas. They can be filled to any depth, watercan be retained for any length of time and then drained in variouscycles.   ``We're really trying to find out how to make wetlands work, howto restore them, how to keep them running,'' Hey says. ``We reallydon't know which kinds of plants do the most in terms of waterpurification.''   Plans ultimately call for another four experimental areas by thetime construction is completed in early 1990, Hey says. Congresshas authorized another $2.2 million for the project, but has notyet appropriated any of the money.   Scientists from many states have visited the site, and in Marcha group of wetlands researchers from China toured the project.   A documentary film and manual on wetlands restoration are alsoplanned.   Lt. Col. Jess Franco, Chicago district coordinator for the ArmyCorps of Engineers, said the corps hoped to use much of the datafrom the project to restore other wetlands.   ``What's being done here can be used for similar wetlandsprojects across the nation,'' Franco says. ``In Louisiana, on thecoast of California, in Florida _ they're different from what wesee in the Midwest. But this is a good first step.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Speaking with the passion of a televisionpreacher, Wes Gordeuk got down on his knees and carefully unrolleda sheaf of documents containing the long-lost secrets of an earlyAmerican inventor.   When he had finished, Gordeuk leaned back and smiled.   Spread across the carpet on his living room floor were theblueprints for an engine that Gordeuk believes was used to powerthe first airplane flight in the United States.   ``There's a hell of a lot of detail here,'' he says.   Gordeuk, an engineer and jet engine instructor at Pratt &amp;Whitney, and Don Richardson, a former electrical engineeringprofessor from Stratford, spent more than two years investigatingthe engine and drafting the blueprint. They are now putting thefinishing touches on the blueprint and some day hope to buildengines based on the plans.   The two are part of a team attempting to prove that GustaveWhitehead made the first powered airplane flight in history on Aug.14, 1901, more than two years before the Wright brothers flew inNorth Carolina. Whitehead allegedly soared 50 feet above the groundfor a distance of about a half-mile at Bridgeport.   Whitehead apparently did nothing to record his flight for futurehistorians. There was mention of the flight in a local Bridgeportnewspaper a few days after it reportedly occurred, and the flightalso was mentioned in Scientific American magazine. But there wereno photographs, workbooks, or other ironclad documentation.   Even the airplane and engines allegedly used didn't survive.Whitehead enthusiasts say that is because, as a tinkerer, Whiteheadconstantly disassembled his inventions and re-used parts for otherwork.   The state of Connecticut in 1964 recognized Whitehead as the``Father of Connecticut Aviation.'' But claims that Whitehead wasthe first in the nation to fly have been rejected by many,including experts at the Smithsonian Institution.   The Connecticut Legislature adopted a bill in 1986 asking theSmithsonian to review the matter, but to no avail.   Undaunted by the skeptics, the Whitehead Research Society hasbeen working to quiet the opposition. It is building a flyingreplica of the plane Whitehead is believed to have flown 88 yearsago. The plane is known as No. 21, an odd-looking, single-wingmachine modeled after a flying fish.   Three years ago, the group unveiled a full-scale model of No. 21that was made of the same materials used by Whitehead _ silk,bamboo and pine. The replica underwent successful tow tests andtethered lift tests.   Gordeuk prepared for the tedious work of reconstructingblueprints for the engines by making two propellers. The64-year-old Cromwell resident followed Whitehead's notes andstudied photographs of No. 21, then spent 13 months carving the two6-foot spruce propellers that were finished in 1985.   To draft the engine blueprints, Gordeuk and Robinson studiedphotographs of the engines and reviewed descriptions by Whitehead'sformer co-workers. In addition, they studied engineering handbooksand hardware catalogs from the turn of the century to help withtheir detective work.   ``Knowing engines, you don't even have to see the whole picture,because even just a part of a picture to an engineer will give thewhole thing away,'' he says.   ``We found that the hardware available and used by GustaveWhitehead in 1901 was exactly the same as it is today. Thestandards have not changed.''   Gordeuk had to go to such extremes because Whitehead left behindno notes on his work. Some believe that his family discarded thematerial many years ago. The scant documentation is one reasonWhitehead's accomplishments have been ignored by history.   ``We've duplicated, we think, within 99 percent of the actualengines,'' Gordeuk says. ``By no means was it easy.''   The two engineers discovered that Whitehead built an externalcombustion engine that was modeled after a steam engine. It wasfueled by acetylene gas, which at the turn of the century wasreadily available and was considered as the fuel of the future.Gasoline, at that time, was considered too dangerous a fuel to beused in engines, Gordeuk says.   Using acetylene, mixed with air, Whitehead developed a unique,lightweight engine with tremendous power, Gordeuk says. Thedouble-acting, four-cylinder engines could produce about 10horsepower a cylinder. Whitehead used one engine per propeller,giving him more horsepower than the Wrights had on their firstairplane, Gordeuk says.   ``He was able to take off after a run of 20 to 25 yards,''Gordeuk says. ``Why was he able to do this? Simply because he had athird engine driving the front wheels of the airplane.   ``The first airplane built that could fly and did fly was ableto take off in any wind conditions or still air in the shortest runthat hasn't been duplicated until recent years. Whitehead was agenius. He was not a liar.''   Having developed blueprints for the engines, the Whitehead grouphas now reached its next obstacle. Gordeuk said the group is inneed of a machine shop to manufacture the engine parts so thatreplica engines can be built. The group has not yet found a machineshop to help.   ``We are at somewhat of a dead end now,'' Gordeuk says.   But he is far from disheartened and he is certain that hisengine and No.21 will fly some day.   ``We're good engineers,'' he says. ``We know it's going to fly.''   The Smithsonian ignored the Connecticut Legislature's requestand has no plans to conduct hearings into the matter, says PeterJakab, the museum's curator of early aviation.   ``The governor signed a piece of legislation asking us toconvene a public hearing,'' he says. ``It's just not appropriatefor us to participate in that way. We're not an arbitrative body.''   The curator says the Wrights fully documented their flight andresearch, while the case for Whitehead is based on speculation. Asa result, the development of the blueprints for the engines isinteresting, but not historically significant, he said.   ``While they claim to have developed the engines,'' he says,``it's impossible to tell.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By DEBBIE NEWBY</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chewing tobacco is like picking the banjo,they say around here, a peculiarly American practice.   So while cigarette manufacturers are battling declining sales inthe United States by opening new markets in Asia and the ThirdWorld, the producers of smokeless tobacco still must look to thehomefolks.   Luther Pittman, executive vice president of operations forPinkerton Tobacco Co. in Owensboro concedes today's chewing tobaccomarket is ``a mature industry.'' He should know. He grew up on atobacco farm in North Carolina and has worked in the tobaccobusiness for 41 years.   ``The only way we're going to get a lot of growth will be gettingbusiness from our competition,'' says Pittman, whose company formore than 100 years has been producing chewing tobacco with nameslike Red Man, Spark Plug, Day's Work, Brown's Mule and A Man's Chew.   ``Of course, they're trying to do the same thing.''   That's not to say everybody has quit chewing and spitting.   Despite the repeated warnings about the dangers of tobacco,Americans still poked more than 64 million pounds of loose-leaf chewinto their cheeks last year, not counting the hard plugs of chewingtobacco.   Production of all smokeless tobacco products _ which includessnuff _ declined from 133.7 million pounds in 1985 to 125.5 millionpounds in 1986, and slipped another 3.2 percent in 1987, accordingto figures compiled by John Maxwell of Wheat First Securities inRichmond, Va.   One reason for chewing tobacco's decline, Maxwell says, is itsinconvenience and the way co-workers view spitting in public.   ``It goes OK on the playing field, but it doesn't go over toowell in the office,'' he says.   But even that wad in the jaw of a baseball player these days islikely to be bubble gum. And who's seen a spittoon in service lately?   Pinkerton's research indicates people who chew are mostlyblue-collar males, with use pretty well spread among people 25 to 55years of age, Pittman says.   ``We had always looked at our customers as being farmers,construction people, miners _ people who use both hands inworking,'' Pittman says. ``It's easier for them to chew tobacco thanit is to smoke.''   But the market may be changing slightly. Recent company surveysshow 20 percent of smokeless tobacco users have household incomes ofmore than $50,000, he says.   The Pinkerton Tobacco Co. is a privately held subsidiary of ThePinkerton Group of Richmond, which is owned by Swedish Tobacco Co.in Stockholm.   Maxwell's figures indicate Pinkerton's biggest competitor forloose-leaf customers is Conwood Co L.P. based in Memphis, Tenn.,which makes Levi Garrett.   Levi Garrett edged slightly ahead of Red Man in 1988, Maxwellsays, selling 17.95 million pounds to Red Man's 17.75 million pounds.   Regardless of who the competition is, marketing is a big part ofstaying ahead, Pittman says.   The company advertised primarily on TV before the federalgovernment banned such ads. Now it uses newspapers, magazines andpromotional events, such as tractor pulls.   It makes about 500,000 of the familiar Red Man caps a year forpromotional purposes.   Pinkerton employs 520 workers at its plant in western Kentucky,where it makes 14 brands of plug chewing tobacco, seven brands ofloose-leaf and nine brands of pipe tobacco. (Workers are notrequired to use tobacco, but those who do are entitled to one freePinkerton product of their choice per day.)   The fragrant smell of tobacco fills the packing room floor at theOwensboro plant. Even ardent tobacco opponents probably would haveto admit the place smells wonderful.   But while the fragrance is allowed to linger, scraps are not. Asworkers run machinery and oversee packing operations, others sweepup loose pieces of tobacco.   ``People who come in here say they're utterly amazed at how cleanit is,'' Pittman says. ``But we're manufacturing a product peopleuse orally. We've got to keep it clean.''   Inside the factory, a pouch of tobacco can be cut, folded,filled, boxed and on a conveyor belt within three minutes. The plantproduces hundreds of thousands of pouches a day.   The company's 2,000 wholesale customers order by telephone or faxmachine, and workers record the orders on a sophisticated computersystem.   Here are some other facts about the chewing tobacco business:   _Pinkerton, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1987, movedits factory from Toledo, Ohio, to Owensboro in 1973.   _Though Pinkerton uses Kentucky-grown tobacco in some products,Red Man is made primarily from tobacco grown in Wisconsin andPennsylvania, with smaller amounts from Connecticut.   _North Carolina leads in total volume of chewing tobaccoconsumed. Kentucky ranks eighth.   Heading a company that makes tobacco products isn't a problem forPittman.   ``I've literally been in tobacco all my life,'' he says.   ``I use all forms of tobacco. The only answer I can give is I'mworking in an industry that manufactures and sells a perfectlylegitimate, legal product supporting consumer demand.   ``Tobacco has paid an awful lot of bills since the Revolution andeven before.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By DENIS D. GRAY</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ANGKOR, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the shadows of war receding fromancient Angkor, the international community is mobilizing to rescuefrom decay one of civilization's greatest artistic achievements.   The Hindu and Buddhist edifices, dating from the ninth through12th centuries, have been assaulted by jungle growth, monsoon rainsand thieves as armies clashed around them over the past two decades.   India, the only non-communist nation to recognize the pro-Hanoigovernment in Phnom Penh, is already restoring the colossal AngkorWat, the crowning jewel, but hundreds of other temples andarchitectural relics from Cambodia's Golden Age remain untended.   Security has been a major problem in recent years, with theKhmer Rouge and other anti-government guerrillas within strikingdistance of Angkor. And diplomatic isolation of the Phnom Penhgovernment has prevented most international assistance.   While the guerrillas remain a potential threat, there isoptimism that a peaceful political solution may be reachedfollowing the promised withdrawal of Vietnamese troops fromCambodia in September.   ``We are waiting for the first available opportunity to restorethe magnificent monuments,'' says Mahfuz Anam, regional spokesmanfor the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.``UNESCO's director general is hopeful of a political solution.''   Although it is restricted from working with the Phnom Penhgovernment, which the United Nations does not recognize, UNESCOthis spring quietly dispatched two experts for a preliminary,on-site diagnosis of Angkor's ills.   UNESCO may help organize an international symposium on Angkorand eventually launch a worldwide fund-raising campaign such asthose which helped resurrect Egypt's pyramids, Indonesia'sBorobudur temple and the ancient north African city of Carthage.   ``Everyone wants to get involved in Angkor,'' said one Westernaid official in Phnom Penh.   Ung Von, who heads Cambodia's conservation effort here, says thePoles will arrive late this year to begin work on the Bayon, anintricate, 800-year-old shrine of mysterious galleries and 54 stonetowers sculpted with the faces of smiling dieties.   The wondrous structure is currently looked after by two oldsweepers and guarded by two teen-age policemen. Its eastern gatecaved in like a deck of cards several years ago. Green algae andwhite fungi mar its friezes of ancient battles and court life.   The French, who hacked Angkor out of the jungle in the lastcentury and became its most expert overseers, refuse to providevaluable archival material to Phnom Penh but have asked to restorethe 11th-century Baphuon, Ung Von says.   The Indians are midway through their six-year, $1O millionproject to renew Angkor Wat, a massive representation of the Hinducosmos in stone which rises in three successive flights to fivecentral towers that have become the symbol of Cambodia.   The work by 13 Indians and more than 400 Cambodians has includedcleaning the friezes, dismantling and reassembling the gateways,and the excavation of ditches to allow drainage of water within themoat-girded complex.   The work on Angkor Wat's nearly 1,440 square yards of friezes ispainstaking. Brushes are used to scrub off moss, insect nests andclinging vegetation, the latter sometimes requiring injections ofweed killer in a syringe. Other chemicals are used to attack fungi,micro-vegetable matter and corrosive bat droppings before aprotective coating is applied.   Heavy machinery is limited to the occasional use of a borrowedcrane while obtaining construction supplies like cement is alogistical nightmare. Work proceeds with the use of hands, hoes andbamboo baskets, not unlike the way Angkor Wat was probablyconstructed.   Some old, expert craftsmen who had worked with the French havereturned but Ung Von says local expertise was decimated during theKhmer Rouge rule and by lack of training since. Some also criticizethe Indians.   ``They need our help,'' Ung Von says. ``Sometimes they don'thave the experience. They have done their job well but theirtechnique is different from the French.''   Some Cambodians and Westerners say privately that the Indianteam uses inferior chemicals, is reassembling galleries in a waythat allows water seepage, and is stubbornly clinging to sometechniques abandoned by international leaders in conservation.   But an expert, independent evaluation of their work has yet tobe made and the Cambodians are publicly reluctant to criticizebecause they have made a major political issue of non-communistIndia coming to their aid.   The Indian restoration, which began in 1987, was the firstmeaningful attempt to keep the rapid deterioration at bay sinceFrench archaeologist Bernard-Phillipe Groslier was expelled fromAngkor by the Khmer Rouge in 1972.   Angkor has fought against the elements since being abandoned inthe 15th century as the capital of a once-powerful Cambodianempire. The Khmer Rouge occupied the area during their war againstthe U.S.-backed government in Phnom Penh and did nothing to restoreAngkor during their brutal time in power.   Since 1979, the pro-Hanoi government has made efforts but withvery few resources and expertise. Now, says Ung Von, there areprospects for real progress and small numbers of foreign touristsare starting to return.   ``I feel like a sick man who is starting to feel well again,''he says.	</TEXT><NOTE>By DIANNE HENK</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sanitation workers tore into a plasticgarbage bag, searching for clues. The giveaway could have been areceipt, a letter.   In the end, an unopened envelope from a mail-order publishingcontest was the telltale evidence needed to trace the smelly bagback to its source.   A police officer who follows the local garbage truck as part ofthe new garbage detail tracked down the culprit _ one of the manypeople since January who've had to be told they were mishandlingtheir garbage. About 20 have been actually arrested and fined forviolating city codes on trash disposal.   Garbage _ and how to throw it away _ has taken on a whole newmeaning for the 7,900 residents of this city since the countylandfill was closed last fall for pollution violations.   People in Columbia County don't simply drag the weekly trash tothe curb anymore. Garbage disposal takes thought and time and money.   City residents must place $2 stickers on their garbage bags orelse it won't be picked up. That's because the county has to comeup with an estimated $6 million to handle the costs of shipping itstrash elsewhere.   Hudson residents who consistently refuse to use the stickers canbe assessed a $15 service charge, plus a $5 charge per bag, whichis placed on their quarterly city water and sewer bills.   But even the sticker system isn't foolproof.   When the program began in December, there were some complaintsof sticker stealing. Then, the stickers didn't stick well in coldweather and more than one resident has been seen chasing after anairborne sticker on a cold and windy day. Now the county isconsidering giving up the stickers and selling garbage bags instead.   ``It's difficult. It really is,'' says Paulette Riegel, standingbehind the counter of her furniture and craft store. ``You neverknew garbage was worth so much.''   ``My animals love it, because they are getting more scraps fromthe table than ever,'' adds Riegel, who seems to be taking the newregulations in stride. At least one customer had already ordered aspecial wooden garbage bin with different sections for recycling,which soon will become mandatory countywide.   Down the main street, another store owner said she called thecounty to ask how to best dispose of hundreds of cardboard boxesfrom shipments to her store. Because cardboard recycling hadn't yetbeen implemented, she was told to cut the boxes up into littlepieces, place them in garbage bags and put them at the curb _ WITHthe mandatory sticker on the bag.   The boxes remained at the store until she gave them to acommunity group.   Other people haven't been that conscientious.   Some folks just wouldn't adhere to the new rules at first,prompting the special police garbage enforcement team.   ``People who reside outside the city were bringing their garbageinto the city and dumping it in the alleys,'' says Police ChiefJames Dolan Jr. On the up side, he says, compliance is improving.   Reaction from residents has been ``a very mixed bag,'' saysCounty Board of Supervisors Chairman Francis Blake.   Liquor store owner Julie Goldweitz says the recycling andsticker program is ``a pain in the neck, but other than that itmakes perfect sense to me. We're doing what we should have beendoing for years. If that's the real cost of us living here on thisplanet, then we have to pay for it.''   The rest of New York State _ and the nation _ might do well tolearn from the misfortune of Columbia County, if they aren'talready in the throes of garbage disposal problems, government andindustry officials say.   ``It is not unusual in these times for counties ormunicipalities _ in the East especially _ to find themselves withno disposal alternative,'' says Joe Salimondo, editor of Waste Agemagazine in Washington, D.C.   Some big cities have already run out of landfill space and nowexport their garbage at a very high cost, he says.   The infamous Long Island garbage barge, which spent eight weeksat sea in 1987 and was rejected by several states and threecountries, was a prime example of garbage with no place to go.   Philadelphia had a similar experience with a freighter that wasladen with 14,000 tons of ash that sailed the seas for two years.It was rejected by at least 11 countries and eventually turned upempty in Singapore after changing names and owners.   ``The worst situation for waste disposal is in the northeasternpart of the United States because of the population density and thelack of availability of disposal sites,'' says Ross Patten, vicepresident of Browning-Ferris Industries, a national waste disposalcompany based in Houston. ``Other parts of the country are not asacutely affected, other than California.''   ``Columbia County should serve as a warning to a lot of othercommunities who haven't taken affirmative action toward resolvingtheir solid waste problems,'' says R.W. Groneman, a spokesman forthe state Department of Environmental Conservation.   In New York, where 20 million tons of garbage are producedannually, the state has implemented tough new standards onlandfills and has a set a goal of reducing or recycling 50 percentof the waste stream by the mid-1990s.   A number of New York communities are building new landfills,composting leaves, implementing recycling and requiring use ofspecial garbage bags to raise revenue for increased garbagedisposal costs.   Unfortunately, Columbia County's problem was a politicalfootball and nothing was done until the issue reached crisisproportions.   ``The landfills that we as a nation have built over the yearsare filling up,'' Salimondo says. ``But the public reaction tolandfills _ thanks to the whole earth movement of the last 18 years_ have made people aware that they don't want a landfill in theirback yard.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By DON BEMAN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police removed a steamer trunk from theapartment of Philadelphia's star flower child 10 years ago and theworld created by the Unicorn began to wither.   The trunk contained the remains of Helen Maddux, a blonde formercheerleader known as Holly, Ira Einhorn's lover.   She had been missing for 18 months by the time privateinvestigators hired by her family in Tyler, Texas, pieced togetherenough information to point an accusing finger at Einhorn, untilthen a living symbol of non-violence with incredible personal charmand a nimble intelligence.   Today the Unicorn is a fugitive from justice and faces a murdertrial if he ever gets caught.   Einhorn was a '60s hippie guru of drugs and free love who rodethe tide of peace and unity to acceptance as a corporateguru-consultant in the '70s. People looked to Einhorn for guidanceas the New Age dawned. He became a Harvard fellow and anenvironmental leader as he and the times matured, though he stilldressed as a campus radical did, right down to the ponytail.   ``He was a very engaging person,'' recalls Thacher Longstreth,former president of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and now acity councilman. ``I have nothing but respect for what he was, orseemed to be.''   An investigative journalist who chronicled Einhorn's case in arecent book said the Unicorn was both product and property ofPhiladelphia. The city nurtured him and worshiped him. The City ofBrotherly Love was also his stage and Einhorn was the ringmaster,wrote New York City's Steven Levy.   Einhorn was a founder of the Free University at the Universityof Pennsylvania in 1964, organizer of the city's first Be-In in1967, first Smoke-In in 1969, Earth Day in 1970 and Sun Day in1978. He was an expert in the paranormal and spoke at conclavesaround the world.   But the battered and partially mummified body in the steamertrunk, along with some new and startling revelations by Levy, ledinvestigators and finally even his close supporters to concludethat there was a very dark side to the Unicorn.   ``It's a shame,'' Longstreth says, because here was a man whoheld in his power the magic of the mythical creature whose name heused as his own. The Unicorn focused the attention of the nation onhimself, on the environment and on Philadelphia when he organizedthe city's Earth Day observance.   ``It was truly wonderful,'' Longstreth says, recalling the daythousands gathered to honor the sanctity of Earth and mankind inPhiladelphia and in other cities. But the premiere event was inPhiladelphia, on Independence Mall near the Liberty Bell. TheUnicorn presided as the television cameras zoomed in to show himkissing Sen. Edmund Muskie full on the mouth.   Levy said the Unicorn was more than just a nickname. It was anideal for Einhorn.   ``Since someone had pointed out how his name (Einhorn = OneHorn) relates to the mythical horse-like creature with a singlehorn between the eyes, Ira had fancied himself as kin to thatmythical creature, representing purity, uniqueness, gentleness andsexual power,'' Levy wrote.   The Philadelphia district attorney's office and police thinkhe's still got some of the magic because he's still running free.   ``Somehow, he's still able to get the confidence of some people,especially women, it seems,'' says Terry Williamson, a spokesmanfor the district attorney's office. ``But he's a brutal killer asfar as we're concerned.''   Einhorn was arrested on March 28, 1979, and charged with themurder of Miss Maddux. The arrest shared the headlines of anotherbig event that day, the worst nuclear accident ever at Three MileIsland power plant in Middletown, Pa.   He claimed innocence and said it was a CIA-KGB frame. He wasable to get the services of a top attorney of the time, ArlenSpecter, now a U.S. senator.   But evidence of a frame didn't surface and in January of 1981,while free on bail, the Unicorn skipped. His trial was to begin inFebruary or March.   Einhorn grew up in Philadelphia's Jewish neighborhoods, attendedthe University of Pennsylvania and was among the many caught up inthe activism of the Vietnam era. Levy grew up within a mile ofEinhorn, attended the same high school where Einhorn studied andplayed football. There was a chance face-to-face meeting while Levywas working on the underground newspaper known as the Drummer.   Those memories prompted his decision to research and write ``TheUnicorn's Secret,'' which was published in October.	</TEXT><NOTE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ewa Letowska, the first and onlygovernment ombudsman in the East bloc, likes to tell the tale oftwo frogs who fell into a vat of milk: One drowned but the otherkept swimming until he churned butter and climbed out.   She's been swimming hard for a year now.   When Mrs. Letowska opened Poland's ombudsman's office in January1988, she had 1,800 letters on her desk and 18 people waiting inline. And the deluge hasn't subsided. She has received 55,000cases, an ``absolute world record,'' and many times the numberfacing her 40 or so counterparts in the West.   Why have so many Poles turned to her for help?   ``Frustration'' is Mrs. Letowska's explanation.   The Polish parliament created the ombudsman's office in July1987 as part of legal reforms aimed at curbing abuse by thecommunist-run bureaucracy and making government agencies moreaccountable.   The law allows the ombudsman to operate independently during herfour-year term, with immunity from prosecution. She can demandinformation from officials for her investigations _ except in casesinvolving the military, national security or state secrets _ andfile administrative or court appeals.   It took an extensive search to find an ombudsman acceptable tothe government while independent enough not to be dismissedout-of-hand by the opposition led by the Solidarity union.   Mrs. Letowska, an exuberant, erudite 48-year-old expert on civillaw and consumer rights, started work on Jan. 4, 1988 with nostaff, no equipment and no methodology.   ``The first day of the ombudsman's work opened a great stream ofcomplaints against everything and everybody and, after one month,another wave, this time of curses and abuses from people who didn'treceive answers,'' she told the parliament in her first annualreport.   There is plenty for Poles to complain about, from 15-year waitsfor housing to the seemingly inconquerable mazes of forms, stampsand ``arrangements'' required for many transactions.   Mrs. Letowska says the volume of cases forces her to look forgroups representing ``typical, repeatable mistakes of the legalsystem and functioning of the state violating people's rights andfreedoms.''   For example, she took on numerous cases concerning Warsawlandowners still not compensated as promised for propertiesnationalized after World War II. Parliament now has ordered theclaims be resolved.   Mrs. Letowska, who is also host of a radio program on opera withher lawyer husband, discusses her work in a newspaper column and ona television show. She recently delivered a lecture at the EuropeanLaw Center in London.   She has compared notes with the other ombudsmen in the West andnon-aligned Yugoslavia and found ``the only difference is thenumber of cases, and maybe the expectations, because people thereprobably don't want apartments from them since they have themalready.''   Mrs. Letowska says she looks at the legal issues in a case, notthe political issues.   As she puts it, ``I don't deal with political prisoners. I dealwith toilets in prisons. If there are cleaner toilets, bothpolitical prisoners and non-political prisoners will benefit.''   This legalistic path can be hard to follow in politicizedPoland. The head of the Solidarity commission monitoring humanrights faults Mrs. Letowska for a reluctance to take on politicalcases or drastic cases of corruption, but he directs most of hiscriticism at the system itself.   ``The ombudsman's office is an institution that is in a ratherhopeless situation,'' says Zbigniew Romaszewski. ``The legal systemof this country is simply broken and there is general anarchy. Theauthorities have used the law completely as an instrument anddestroyed it in this way.''   Mrs. Letowska, who describes herself as ``a lawyer from head totoe, not a bureaucrat,'' also is disturbed by the degree ofdistrust for the government bureaucracy that decides pensions andthe like.   But, she adds, ``It's not that everything is being regulatedfrom the top. There is the law.''   In a country where the average wait to get a telephone is 13years, Mrs. Letowska ruled recently that telephone workers shouldnot have priority for obtaining phone service, as had been providedby a special regulation. Such privileges, she said, give rise to``a sense of social injustice.''   Yet she does not argue against special shops for miners and freeelectricity for power workers when institutionalized as laws.   ``There is a fundamental difference between legal acts grantingprivileges to specific professional groups of special significanceto the national economy and privileges usurped by...internalregulations,'' she wrote.   During her first year, Mrs. Letowska organized doctors to handleprison health complaints, filed nine appeals to Poland's supremecourt, looked into complaints that letters from the West are heldup or damaged by the post office, and took up the causes _ amongmany others _ of a prisoner trying to get information about herchildren at an orphanage, a woman denounced by a son-in-law tryingto get her apartment, and the widow of an officer executed duringthe Stalinist period.   There are 55 lawyers and office workers handling the cases, butno computer. Three guards keep a list of waiting clients and twoaides screen for emergency cases.   About 23 percent of the complaints filed with the ombudsmanconcern the justice system, and about the same percentage involvesocial welfare problems, such as pensions and insurance.   Seventeen percent have to do with housing, 12 percent withproperty disputes, another 12 percent concern financial matters and3 percent with education, cultural and health service problems.   About 10 percent of her cases concern civil rights but Mrs.Letowska says surprisingly few are purely political.   ``There is a general picture in the West that people arerepressed or fired from their jobs for their views,'' she says.While that's often true, she says, sometimes politics has nothingto do with the firing.   She cites as an example an engineer at a town's only factory whohas a fight with his boss.   ``The guy will say, `They are harassing me because of politicalreasons,' and there are no politics in the whole case.   ``I cannot convince those people they are not being repressedfor their views, but for everything in general. Such cases wouldn'tsee daylight in the West.''	
</TEXT><NOTE>By EARL BOHN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>STAHLSTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Larry Barth is a heavyweight in a worldwhere a gram of wood shavings fluttering onto his workbench canrepresent a hard day's work.   He carves birds.   The sharp steel edges of Barth's chisels bite into blocks ofbasswood and tupelo and find song birds, predators and game birdsthat possess an air of movement. With that he is helping totransform wildfowl carving into something more than a sportsmen'scraft.   ``There's a tremendous interest in wildlife art and probably hasbeen for the past 10 or 15 years,'' says Sam Dyke, immediate pastpresident of the Ward Foundation, a non-profit arts and educationorganization which sponsors an international competition in OceanCity, Md. ``But it's certainly not the kind of art that endures.It's maybe calendar art. It's not generally regarded as fine art.Larry's work is.''   Barth, 31, works in a quiet, well-lighted shop in his home amonghardwood forests and manicured farms in the Laurel Mountains, 50miles east of Pittsburgh.   He is usually at his bench from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m., breaking forlunch and supper. He often returns to work when the hubbub ofevenings with his wife, Linda, and their two young childrendissolves into night.   ``For fun I go out and do brute force things that don't require alot of precision _ splitting firewood or building stone walls aroundthe place.   ``That feels really good after a day of removing a gram of woodfrom feathers the size of your fingernail.''   Barth prefers to carve song birds, but is getting more mileageout of birds of prey.   ``I'm not into ducks,'' he says.   Some people are. A decoy of a pintail carved by Elmer Crowell ofMassachusetts was auctioned several years ago for a record $319,000.   That was probably an ``aberration'' in an emerging and unsettledmarket, says Curtis Badger, editor of Wildfowl Art, the WardFoundation's quarterly magazine.   The Ward Foundation purchases each year's winning entry for$20,000, but antique decoys are where the big money is.   ``You have to do what you know,'' Barth says. ``What I know aboutare song birds, upland game birds and birds of prey.''   Before lifting a knife or a chisel, Barth studies the bird heplans to carve. He reads books, examines pictures and museumexhibits and watches them in life, often at a bird-banding stationthat Carnegie Museum operates a half- mile from his house.   After the drawing comes the critical rendering in clay.   ``Once I have the clay model done, as far as I'm concerned, thepiece is done,'' he says. ``The toughest decisions I make are in theclay. After that it's just technical execution...the noodling out ofthe detail.''   Carving the wood can be grueling. Gluing blocks of wood togetherand roughly shaping them with chisels is followed by the tedium ofcarving the feathers, detailing each down to the space between thebarbs.   ``I'm dealing with the top one-sixteenth of an inch of thewood,'' he says.   He chars the wood with an electrically heated blade to create thedistinct, hard feathers of the tail and wings, and he grinds thewood to create the loose, soft feathers of the body.   Barth established himself as a new force in the field withback-to-back world class titles at Ocean City.   He won in 1985 with a formidable and confident snowy owl, atrest, smugly clutching a limp Bonaparte gull. Barth repeated thenext year with a pair of airborne terns, one flaring its tail andwingtips, the other tucking a wing and arching its tail as the twobirds bank left in tight formation.   Most recently, Barth received a commission from the prestigiousLeigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum in Wausau, Wis.   The Woodson Museum, a general art museum with a specialtycollection of wildlife art, is paying Barth an undisclosed sum for acarving of his choice. Indulging his preference for robust, chunkybirds, Barth is carving a tern being chased by two jaegers, theblack-hooded bullies of the seashore.   ``He's showing situations that seem almost impossible to present,given the medium,'' says Kathy Foley, director of the WoodsonMuseum. ``Larry is a maverick, a marvel, a master. He's carvedcircles around people who've been carving longer than Larry's beenalive.''   The Woodson commission is the latest in a series of honors Barthhas received since he jumped into the spotlight at age 21 with afamily of great horned owls that won second place at the 1979 Wardcompetition.   Until then, he had carved in isolation, making his own tools anddeveloping his own techniques after being drawn to the craft throughhis father's interest in wood carving and his mother's interest inbird watching.   Barth was in the ninth grade when he carved his first bird, athumb-size attempt at a rufous-sided towhee. He still has the black,brown and white carving.   A series of birds emerged from a sugar pine plank from thefamily's picnic table. Barth sold many of his early carvings toflorists and others to use as decorations.   Cornell University accepted him to study ornithology, but Barthrealized at the last minute that he didn't care how a bird's liverworks, only what the bird looks like. He entered Carnegie MellonUniversity to prepare for a career in illustration. Carving remainedhis hobby.   He later redefined his major to carving.	</TEXT><NOTE>By ED BLANCHE</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iran's Islamic revolution has survived 10turbulent years against all the odds _ bloody internal strife, acrippling eight-year war with Iraq and the hostility of much of theworld.   On Feb.11, 1979, nine days after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,nemisis of the Shah of Shahs, returned to Tehran in triumph from 15years of exile, his bearded revolutionaries seized the reins ofgovernment when the last monarchist government collapsed.   Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had already gone into exile Jan. 16,his 40-year reign on the Peacock Throne imploding in anarchy, hisimperial regime notorious for corruption and torture. Khomeini'syears in power have, by many accounts, been a mirror image.   Nonethless, many of Iran's 50 million people will take to thestreets this week to mark the anniversary of the Islamic revolutionas the country stumbles, at last, out of a decade behind the darkIslamic veil of self-imposed isolation.   But beneath that mood of celebration, the country faces a futureof political uncertainty, exhaustion from the conflict with itsancient Arab enemy, deep economic malaise and debate about whichpath the revolution must now take.   There are some indications of the direction the revolution ismoving under Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, the country'sleading pragmatist and, for the time being at least, the mostpowerful figure after Khomeini.   Acknowledging that revolutionary zealotry unnecessarily estrangedIran from the rest of the world, he is the driving force behindmoves to the isolation that began with the November 1979 seizure ofthe U.S. embassy and deepened with Tehran's support for anti-WesternShiite terrorism and hostage-taking in Lebanon.   He also acknowledged in October that the revolution, the warnotwithstanding, has also failed to improve conditions for the``mostathafin,'' or the dispossessed, in whose name the revolutionwas waged.   ``We still have not been able to clarify for people economicbenefits as befits Islam, as we have differences of opinion amongourselves over these issues,'' he said. ``We have not yet tackledthe day-to-day aspects of Islamic rule.''   Above all, Iranians are increasingly obsessed with how muchlonger Khomeini will live and what will happen when he dies.   The stern-faced Shiite Moslem spiritual leader, father of therevolution and its undisputed authority, is 88 years old andreported in poor health, rarely venturing from his heavily guardedresidence in the Jamaran suburb of north Tehran, where the shah'selite once lived.   When he dies, Iran faces a power struggle between its leadersthat some Iranians fear could even start a civil war.   Most political analysts believe that the revolution will survivethat expected turmoil, but that its ideological makeup will likelyundergo considerable change, depending on which faction comes out ontop.   For the time being, Rafsanjani and his allies, who includePresident Ali Khamenei, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati andKhomeini's son, Ahmed, who controls access to his ailing father inhis north Tehran stronghold, appear to have the upper hand.   But they face stiff challenges in the days ahead from hardlinerssuch as Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, Prime MinisterHussein Musavi and others who fear his policies are eroding therevolution's Islamic purity.   ``The revolution has endured and it's there to stay,'' saidHans-Heino Kopietz, a seasoned analyst of Iranian affairs with theLondon-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.   ``But revolutions do not remain rigid for very long because thereare too many internal pressures,'' he said in a telephone interview.   ``A civil war after Khomeini dies is a possibility. The powercenter in Tehran will probably be strong enough to prevent Iran'spolarizing, but the revolution will have to redefine itself if it isto survive.''   Philip Robbins, an analyst with London's Royal Institute forInternational Affairs, said, ``Outsiders have focused largely on thenegative aspects of the last 10 years in Iran _ its failure in thewar and in the economy, two of its flagship policies. But therevolution has done more than just get rid of the shah. Iran is nowvery much its own boss. It has asserted its independence veryforcefully.   ``Whether or not you like the regime, its self-confidence andsurvival have to be recognized.''   The war with Iraq, in which by some Western estimates 1 millionIranians were killed and tens of thousands maimed, was a unifyingforce that muted the bickering in the hierarchy and maintainedrevolutionary momentum.	</TEXT><NOTE>By ED WHITE</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hoist a frothy stein to Siebel Institute ofTechnology _ Brewmaster U. _ where all the students strive forbetter beer.   ``I would call it the Harvard of the brewmaster schools,'' saysrecent graduate James Whilt Timper of Belleville, Ill.   Since 1901, excluding Prohibition of course, the Siebel Institutehas been turning out many of the world's brewmasters, who create thebeer that's quaffed at the corner tap.   ``The people at Siebel's have my highest admiration. It's uniquein the country,'' says Michael Lewis, a professor of brewing scienceat the University of California-Davis.   And the graduation pictures that hang on the second floor carrysome of the biggest names in suds: John W. Stroh Jr., class of '59;August A. Busch III, class of '61; August Pabst, class of '67.   Siebel Institute is an arm of J.E. Siebel Sons' Co., whose rootsdate to 1868 when the city of Chicago's chief chemist, a huskyGerman immigrant with a flowing beard, started a small laboratory tointroduce European brewing techniques to the United States.   The North Side lab, a few feet from the screeching wheels ofelevated commuter trains, moved downtown after World War II, andthen to its current site among large homes and small industriesChicago's far Northwest Side in the 1950s.   In the basement, staff scientists have their own micro-brewery,which produces 22 liters of beer a few times a month for researchpurposes.   The two-story, brick building modestly bears the name Siebel overthe entrance, giving no hint to passersby that the great-grandsonsof J.E. Siebel Sr. are now at the helm of a company that trainsbrewmasters and acts as a consultant to breweries big and small,from Guatemala to Detroit, Canada to India.   Each fall, Siebel Institute accepts 25 to 30 students for an11-week course in ``brewing technology.'' Most are employees ofbreweries around the world sent to Chicago for classroom andlaboratory training and then promoted to brewmaster or assistantbrewmaster when they return.   All expenses _ tuition, hotel and food _ are normally paid by thestudent's brewery.   The $5,650 course is divided into eight subjects: raw materials,brewhouse theory, fermentation, storage, packaging, quality control,laboratory and taste.   While there are many brewing academies in Europe, especially WestGermany, the Siebel Institute has few peers in the United States.The University of California-Davis offers undergraduate degrees infood science with an emphasis on brewing, but the Chicago schoolsays it's the only one that takes people from inside the industryand turns them into brewmasters.   The school accepts few students who do not have a brewingbackground, though some with a ``fair amount of self-study and highdegree of determination'' can get through the door, says ExecutiveVice President William R. Siebel.   ``What they're taught here is the theory and the science behindmalt beverages, from the various raw materials to their ultimate usein the brewhouse,'' says Siebel, who can't recall anyone who didn'tpass the course. ``We're not teaching any specific formulas to makecertain beers. At their breweries, they use their own formulas. Theart is learned on the job.''   To the armchair drinker, a beer occasionally might taste bad. Butat Siebel Institute, students are taught to determine if a beertastes fruity, skunky, burnt or grainy.   It's not all work. During lunch or after classes, students areusually found in the second-floor ``bierstube'' where they quiz eachother about the day's lessons or play pool, while eating snacks anddowning mugs of free beer, compliments of big-name beer companies.   ``When you get a student from Tasmanian,'' says Siebel, referringto an Australian brewery, ``and a novice from California, they'regoing to pick up all kinds of insights.   ``They're talking beer all the time.''   Cynthia L. Bauer has worked at a Stroh Brewery plant in Van Nuys,Calif., for four years and was recently promoted to assistantbrewmaster.   Beer, she says, is a language everyone understands.   ``You can talk about beer to anybody; I'm not talking abouthigh-tech lasers,'' she says. ``On the other hand, it's veryscientific. There are 1,000 different ways to skin a cat and 1,000different ways to make beer. That's why we're here.''   Ms. Bauer, 28, was one of two women who graduated in themost-recent class. Does she feel like a pioneer in an industrydominated by men?   ``What's your image of a brewmaster?'' she replies. ``An old guywith a bit of a belly. Well, these guys are retiring, moving on.Granted there are not too many women, but we'll make it.''   Unlike most of his classmates, Timper, 31, is unemployed andsimply wants to get his foot back into the business. He was aproduction worker at Stag Brewery in Southern Illinois, but itclosed a few months ago and Timper was not transferred.   He had to borrow money for the Siebel tuition.   ``I had a choice: stand in a long, unruly unemployment line or bea student,'' Timper says. ``Siebel is considered a very goodsteppingstone to further a career or start one. It has the marketcornered. This whole thing is a gamble I needed to take.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By FRANK FISHER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The members of the Antique Radio Clubaren't very impressed with a fancy computer during ``Show andTell,'' even if the palm-sized gadget does decipher Morse code atthe speed of light.   But when someone starts passing around a set of stained,yellowed photographs from 1915 depicting one of Schenectady's firstamateur radio stations, a buzz of animated conversation fills thecramped basement where they are meeting.   This is, after all, something the 15 radio buffs, mostconsiderably advanced in age, can understand. Tenderly thumbing thepictures, Carmin Baker wrinkles his brow and smiles.   ``Back then, it was kind of a prestige thing to know, hey, theguy next door is a radio ham,'' Baker says. ``We used to try tohang around him because we were interested in that kind of stuff.''   The other silver-haired radio aficionados nod their heads.They've obviously come here to ``get together with the other guysand see what they got and talk,'' as one member says.   The Schenectady club, affiliated with the Rochester-basedAntique Wireless Association, is one of about 30 scattered aroundthe world, according to Bruce Kelley, the curator of theassociation's museum. All together, there are about 10,000 antiqueor historical radio collectors, mostly in New York state, and ofthose 300 are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission totransmit on the rare radios, Kelley says.   However, there's something about the Schenectady organizationthat suggests it's kind of special.   ``I built Langmuir's personal hi-fi set for him,'' blurts outRobert Thayer, 73, referring to the Nobel Prize-winning chemistIrving Langmuir. ``I put round knobs on the thing and he wentcrazy. He couldn't have a round knob. He wanted a pointer on thereand he wanted to know where every one of the things was set. Hedidn't care how loud it was, but he wanted to know where thatpointer was!''   The memories come rushing back to these proud veterans of an erahalf a century ago when Schenectady, then home to the GeneralElectric and American Locomotive companies, unabashedly calleditself ``the city that hauls and lights the world.''   They talk excitedly about an ``intellectualism'' that oncepermeated the ``Electric City,'' located on the banks of the MohawkRiver 15 miles northwest of Albany. Thomas Alva Edison started itall when he established his machine works in 1886, they say. Sixyears later, the two nondescript brick buildings would become GE.   Besides jobs and prosperity, GE infused a much-needed dose ofself-respect into a town that had too often been the butt of crueljokes. The thankfully forgotten song, ``I Can't SpellSchenectady,'' didn't seem fair to a thriving metropolis that had alively downtown, huge department stores and a citizenry thatincluded scientists such as Guglielmo Marconi.   ``Schenectady was a nice place to live back in the '20s. One ofthe nicest cities in the country,'' boasted club chairman FayEckert. ``Well, they had the Erie Canal here for one thing, up to apoint, anyway, which made it interesting. And it was such a cleancity.''   But all this was before GE pulled out of the radio productionbusiness after World War II, quickly reducing its work force inSchenectady from a wartime high of 45,000 to 12,000. Many of thefolks swapping memories at this reunion were among those thousandslaid off.   Twenty years later, the locomotive company folded, giving a coupde grace to what had been a long downward spiral.   ``Now, nobody comes to Schenectady anymore,'' grumbles FrancisEmrich, a private radio operator for 42 years.   Baker's insistent voice rises above the din: ``When I was ayoung man, everybody got out of college, went down to GE and got ajob in the testing department.''   That's why he, like most of the others, started working for GEin 1940, earning 35 cents an hour on an assembly line.   This was a time when Schenectady breathed, ate and drank radiotechnology, Emrich remembers. The city's skyline bristled with theantennae of ``hm'' radio operators. As a matter of fact, Emrichsays, GE used to give away tubes and other paraphernalia to hams,until unscrupulous individuals began to steal the stuff.   Emrich's a purist, which means he won't use anything but genuineparts in his antique radio transmitters. So, many times, he's hadto search in some pretty odd places for spare parts.   It seems natural to these people that New York's first regularlylicensed radio station, WGY, which first broadcast in February1922, was started by GE in Schenectady. Television, also largelydeveloped by GE, soon followed in 1939. If necessity was the motherof invention, then GE was the doctor who performed the delivery.   ``One thing about GE, their minds were always working down thereto improve things,'' Emrich says.   Jack Nelson, considered the club's patriarch because he reportedto work for GE back in 1928, stands up to announce that the widowof a former friend and club supporter is having a garage sale. Lotsof old radio equipment will be available.   The old radios the members avidly collect and lovingly restoreare becoming scarce, such as the 1924 Westinghouse Nelson keeps inhis cluttered cellar. Or the 1930s Atwater Kent that a beaming EdFarrell showed off in the back of his van at the club's flea marketbefore the meeting.   ``The thing is, when we were kids, a kid that was just mildlyinterested in radio could take a crystal and a pair of earphonesand some wire and make it work,'' says Thayer, his fingers wrappedaround an odd-looking 1936 GE metal tube that he uses as a gavel.``Now, everything is so terrifically complicated that a kid has tobe terrifically interested to get into it. He can't just start witha simple thing and work up.''   Radios, especially antique ones, are fetching high prices also,so much so that Eckert now calls collecting ``a rich man's hobby.''   He leaps at the chance to give an example: A 25-tube ZenithStratosphere from 1939, a luxury radio that stands 5-feet tall andprobably cost $900 then, was recently auctioned for $8,000 inGeorgia.   Eckert's own 33-tube E.H. Scott radio from 1940-41, which hecalls the ``Rolls Royce'' of radios, fetched a price of $350 backthen and now is worth about $750.   ``But,'' he admits, ``it's not in mint condition.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By GEORGE ESPER</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>BRANFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a fit of depression, when her thirdbout with cancer had sounded a death knell, Julia Gebersky inquiredthrough others whether her son, Robert, had a gun and could shoot.   Incontinent, her body scarred by bedsores, she had become aprisoner of her own helplessness. If euthanasia were legal, Bob Gerysaid, he would have helped his mother kill herself.   But there was another way out for Julie Gebersky. Like nearly200,000 patients a year, she awaited her death in hospice, a waystation for the terminally ill that benignly treats them not forprolongation of life but to ease their dying and lessen their pain.   Gery's mother died without much discomfort in the gentle hands ofThe Connecticut Hospice, just as his father had died of cancernearly 13 years ago under the same hospice care.   In that span, the number of hospice care programs in the UnitedStates has grown from fewer than 100 to nearly 1,700, according to a1988 survey by the National Hospice Organization in Arlington, Va.,which provides technical services for its 900 members.   While care is much the same, and about 90 percent of it isprovided in the home, the programs are operated by a variety oforganizations. For example, 41.8 percent of the programs areindependently run, 26.6 percent are run by hospitals, 22.4 percentby agencies that provide care in the home, and 9.2 percent are runby a coalition of organizations such as nursing homes and hospitalsworking together.   ``Hospice is not a place, it's a program of care,'' says IraBates, vice president of the National Hospice Organization. ``We arethe only health care provider that defines the unit of care as boththe patient and the family.''   Hospice does this by sending in a team, including volunteers andsocial workers, to help the family with housework and personalproblems, to maintain the vigil while they take a break and to helpwith funeral arrangements once the patient dies. After that, hospiceworkers keep in touch with the family for at least a year to comfortthem.   Many hospice programs are based in office buildings and leasebeds from hospitals and nursing homes. ``If there is a crisis in thefamily, then we can provide continuous home care in the homearound-the-clock,'' Bates says. ``If that's not enough, then we canmove the patient to an inpatient setting.''   The modern hospice system originated in England in 1967, whenCicely Saunders, a British physician, founded St. Christopher'sHospice.   What brought it about, say hospice authorities, was the leap intechnical advances in medicine since the mid-1950s and theincreasingly common dilemma of terminally ill patients being keptalive, sometimes against their wishes and the wishes of theirfamilies, at high costs in suffering and financial sacrifice.   Even some of those dealt the cruelest of hands in life, AIDSvictims who are not only dying but are homeless, find refuge in somehospices like The Connecticut Hopsice, the first and oldest in theUnited States and a leader in care for the terminally ill in thepast two decades.   Connecticut Hospice began caring for the dying in their homes inMarch 1974 and opened a 44-bed hospice for inpatients in July 1980in Branford. Two years ago, it bought an adjoining home andconverted it into a cottage with five beds for the dying who have nohome or no one to care for them.   Bates says Connecticut Hospice is unique in its much higherproportion of inpatient care to home care. It serves as a teachinghospice as well.   The average hospice, says Bates, has three or four beds, a paidstaff of eight and 50 volunteers, dealing with about 110 patients ayear. The discharge rate is around 10 percent, those who decide toseek treatment or who go into remission.   While hospice patients are mostly elderly cancer victims, as muchas 90 percent, the '80s have brought a new challenge, a youngergeneration afflicted with AIDS, either cast aside by society or inself-imposed exile to keep loved ones from seeing them at theirworst.   The latest data available from the National Hospice Organizationshow hospices served about 2,100 AIDS victims in 1986, among 154,700patients in all. While later figures are not available, Batesestimates the number of AIDS victims cared for will reach 6,000 or7,000.   Among them are men like Keith Jackson, 27, and Eddie Muniz, 36,who found accommodations in The Connecticut Hospice cottage lastyear, their gaunt bodies implanted with catheters, their shoulderspropped up by hospice volunteers and friends so they could walk,their lips barely movable, slurring their speech almost as if they'dsuffered a stroke, and coughing, coughing, coughing.   ``I got a home but I don't want to be near the girls because I'vebeen sick,'' Muniz, an admitted drug dealer and user and the fatherof three daughters, ages 8, 10 and 12, told a visitor last November.``I know I'm gone. I don't want to go...'' He paused. ``Yet.''   Jackson, a fashion model who is gay, lived with his divorcedmother until she died two years ago. He said he would rather live inthe cottage than move in with his father or siblings. ``This is myhome,'' he said.   Nurses, the heart of hospice care, and volunteers, the soul, givethe men medication, feed them, do their laundry and take them out todinner and to shop. Like many of the terminally ill, they dreadabove all dying alone, in confusion and fear. The hospices quietlyease those apprehensions.	</TEXT><NOTE>By GEORGE ESPER</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>HA SON BINH, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On that day in 1967 when the skiesfilled with U.S. warplanes raining bombs, a former North Vietnamesemilitiaman remembers burying an American airman who was shot downin a rice paddy.   On a recent spring day, Bui Van Lai, now 52, along with 10 otherVietnamese men and a group of Americans, were digging for theremains of the missing flier on the land that is now a cornfieldgrazed by water buffalo.   In Vietnam's paddies and peaceful fields sprinkled with violets,in the foreboding triple-canopy jungles, in the chilling waters ofthe South China Sea, from Vietnam westward to Laos and Cambodia,lie the remains of more than 2,300 other Americans also listed asmissing in action.   For 431 of the missing, their final resting place is apparentlyat sea, off the coast of Vietnam, more than half of them from Navycarriers. An 82-day undersea recovery operation using divers andspecial barges 16 years ago was unsuccessful, although somewreckage was found.   Now, after more than a decade of basking in a bittersweetvictory in self-imposed isolation, communist Vietnam is welcomingAmericans back in increasing numbers to search for their fallencomrades, and even joining them in their effort. What Vietnam wantsin return is badly needed American aid for a country that won thewar but couldn't manage the peace.   Even Vietnam's top official for MIAs, Nguyen Can, accompaniesthe joint U.S.-Vietnamese excavation team as Bui Van Lai leads themthrough the mud of Ha Son Binh, a wilderness 45 miles west of Hanoi.   Farmers who once were victims of U.S. air attacks gather incuriosity around the searchers as they map the plot of land wherethe American pilot is believed buried.   Quach Thuc, 68, her teeth rotten from Vietnamese chewingtobacco, points to the sky. ``I saw the crash,'' she says. ``Ididn't want to look. I ran away.''   The second crewman in the plane was captured, spent six years ina prison camp, and was freed by North Vietnam along with 590 otherAmericans during ``Operation Homecoming'' in 1973.   Today, the Americans come armed not with laser bombs, but withcompasses, tape measures, trowels, dental picks and whisk brooms,the tools of the archaeologist. Their mission is to preserve theskeletal remains for their journey home.   Each bone is measured, its position sketched and photographedand then reassembled in a lab, just the way it was found, foridentification.   ``I want the whole bone because I can make the best, mostscientific statement,'' says Peter Miller, a forensicanthropologist and archaeologist with the U.S. CentralIdentification Laboratory in Hawaii. ``If there are teeth in thatjaw, that jaw is going to be fragile. Therefore, I'd better becareful how I dig it out because I want the dentist back in the labto have a whole set of teeth.''   The laboratory has a computerized data base on every tooth ofevery missing American who fought in Vietnam, so if the teeth arerecovered they can be matched with the X-rays.   The Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii, which searchesfor MIAs, has all of the information on the crash, including thesite and names of the missing airmen, based on eyewitness reportsof other pilots and on informants such as Bui Van Lai. From bonefragments alone, Miller can determine the race, sex and age of thevictim.   But on this day and the next, the searchers are unable to findthe American remains, even though they uncovered some pieces ofwreckage. Time has altered the terrain and played tricks with BuiVan Lai's memory. The searchers must move on, but Miller hopes totry again another time.   While other U.S. and Vietnamese search teams crisscross thecountryside in U.S.-made vans, the families back home keep alivetheir last link to the lost. Some 3,600 of them belong to theNational League of Families, which was founded in 1970 to push forthe return of any Americans still alive, the fullest possibleaccounting of those still missing and the repatriation of remains.   ``The league's position is that Americans are still held, apolicy based on history of the issue, known discrepancy cases andthe intelligence information which supports our view,'' says AnnMills Griffiths, executive director of the league, who has abrother among the MIAs.   ``The vast majority of family members believe Americans arealive,'' Mrs. Griffiths says. ``They don't necessarily personalizeit for themselves, saying `I believe my husband's alive.' They say,`I believe Americans are alive. I'm not sure about my ownrelatives.'''   For many families, the mental torture never ends until thefallen are buried.   ``It is a human trait to hope that individual is alive unlessyou have some indication that man is dead,'' Mrs. Griffiths says.``Even though it's sad to lose someone you love, if he's buriedwith military honors, it's done with for you. It's over.''   All of the MIAs except one, Air Force Col. Charles E. Shelton, anative of Owensboro, Ky., have been legally declared dead, so thefamily can collect benefits. Just under half the MIAs were declaredkilled at the time of the battle, based on eyewitness reports, butheavy fire or other circumstances prevented recovery of theirremains.   Shelton was shot down in the mountains of Laos on his 33rdbirthday 24 years ago. U.S. rescuers contacted him by radio on theground and he indicated he was in good condition. Villagers anddefectors told authorities he was taken prisoner by communistLaotian forces.   Shelton is among the so-called ``discrepancy cases,'' in Vietnamand Laos, in which some Americans were alive when last seen and theUnited States has reason to believe they were taken into captivityor turned over to communist authorities.	</TEXT><NOTE>By GEORGE ESPER</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fourteen years after the end of theVietnam War, former foes came face to face for the first time at agovernment workshop in Hanoi where crippled Vietnamese veterans tryto eke out a living.   Nguyen Dinh Vinh, who still feels the pain of an American bulletthat ripped off the left side of his forehead, told a group ofAmerican visitors how he spent a year in an underground fieldhospital code-named ``K-23.'' The hospital, in what was then SouthVietnam, withstood American B-52 bomber strikes and searches by theU.S. infantry.   ``I'm glad we didn't find it,'' said Kevin Bowen of Boston, whohad fought on that same battlefield but was now on a humanitarianmission to aid his former enemies.   As America prepares to honor its nearly 60,000 men and women whodied in Vietnam, as well as the fallen of other wars, many veteranssuch as Bowen no longer hold hatred toward the Vietnamese and areactively working to help people such as Vinh.   At age 38, Vinh's future is bleak. He still suffers bouts ofdizziness and headaches. He and his wife make only $6 a monthbetween them at the An Duong Veterans Workshop in Hanoi, barelyenough to support themselves and their two children, 5 and 10.   But he, too, is no longer bitter toward the Americans.   ``During the war we both suffered,'' Vinh says. ``Through thenews media, I'm aware there is frustration and suffering amongAmerican veterans. I can relate to that. For the Vietnamese, we hadto defend the country and we had to fight. Neither one won the war.It's something neither one of us wanted.''   Vinh is among Vietnam's disabled veterans who strain an alreadybankrupt economy whose unemployment rate is as high as 25 percentin a country so poor it can't even afford wheelchairs for its warvictims or equipment as simple as sewing machines to keep themworking.   Nguyen Dinh Lieu, head of the government's Invalid VeteransSection, says the country is struggling to care for 2.5 millionVietnamese war victims, including 1 million disabled veterans and1.5 million paramilitary and civilians.   An October 1987 report by a U.S. technical team that visitedHanoi estimated that Vietnam was able to fit only 9,000 of anestimated 60,000 amputees who needed artificial limbs andrehabilitation. The report estimated the country needed 30,000wheelchairs.   Estimates put Communist Vietnam's military losses at 600,000 inthe war with the Americans. Vietnam also has 300,000 soldiersmissing in action, according to Nguyen Can, acting director of theVietnam Office for MIAs, although some American veterans who havevisited the country doubt the number of MIAs is that high.   Many veterans with slight or moderate disabilities are sent backto the countryside, to their villages, to work the farmlands fromwhence they came. Some are sent to workshops set up by thegovernment, like An Duong, which produces nails, inner tubes andsports clothes.   Others go with their wives and children to live in disabledveterans homes like those in Tay Ninh Province, 50 miles west of HoChi Minh City, in the southern part of the country.   In one 7{-acre compound, 300 former Viet Cong guerrillas andtheir families are living in homes set aside by the government fordisabled veterans. Legless, paraplegic, blind or scarred by napalm,men and women alike recently made their way to a meeting room togreet visiting American veterans.	</TEXT><NOTE>By GEORGE ESPER</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Vietnamese mothers standpatiently in the bare, overcrowded wards of Pediatric Hospital No.1, holding their babies in their arms, trying to soothe theonslaught of illness and pain.   In these wards are the innocent victims of five decades of warand a failed economy that has left Vietnamese hospitals drained ofeven simple supplies such as sutures, X-ray film and anesthesia.   The signs of malnutrition are everywhere: shriveled childrenweighing only half what they should, their bellies swollen, theirmuscles wasting away, their skin peeling and scabbed, their eyesblinded.   In the burn ward, tiny bodies wrapped in gauze soaked withointment writhe in pain, their hands tethered to keep them fromcontracting and deforming, their faces fixed with fear.   These children were born into a political and economic schismthat has isolated Vietnam from most of the Western world and theaid it needs so badly. The Vietnamese government spent yearssubsidizing war against the French, Japanese, Americans, Chineseand Cambodians instead of investing in medicine, science, educationand the care of its 64 million people.   North Vietnam won the war in 1975, two years after U.S. militaryforces left South Vietnam for good, but its aging communistleadership lost the battle to manage the country in peacetime.After the war, Vietnam closed itself off from the outside world anddid little to improve its socialistic lot.   Indeed, many hospitals such as Pediatric No. 1 are old andill-equipped, inviting infections. Plaster roofs are caving in,air-conditioners are covered with rust and water seeps across thefloors. Most hospitals haven't received any new equipment since theend of the war.   A typical provincial 400-bed general hospital in Tay Ninh westof Ho Chi Minh City has a budget of only $32,500 a year to treatmore than 100,000 patients and pay a staff of nearly 500 people.Despite a 100-bed surgical ward, it has less than half of thesurgical tools it needs, forcing patients to wait for surgery.Surgeons earn a base pay of only $6 a month, what an Americanteen-ager makes in an hour or two at McDonald's.   ``The most important problem for us is the problem ofequipment,'' says Dr. Nguyen Huy Phan, a plastic surgeon andleading member of the State Committee for Science and Technology.   ``It's desperate,'' says Dr. John Constable, a plastic surgeonat Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who was in Vietnam onhis 11th visit to study the effects of Agent Orange and to teach.   Vietnam was distracted from building its economy, its trade andits institutions in 1978 when its armed forces invaded and occupiedCambodia and later fought China in a northern border war.   Western nations, including the United States, ostracized Vietnamfor its occupation of Cambodia. The United States refuses toestablish diplomatic relations with Vietnam and give it aid untilit pulls all of its forces out of Cambodia, elections are held, andCambodia is neutral and non-aligned.   Vietnam claims it has withdrawn all but 50,000 of its troops andwill have those out by Sept. 30. Acknowledging its economicpolicies have failed, Vietnam is courting the United States and itscapitalism as a prelude to what it hopes will be the lifting of anAmerican trade embargo and the return of economic, medical andmanagement aid.   Vietnam now survives on aid from the Soviet Union and somehumanitarian aid from some Western countries. Some assitance comesfrom non-government charitable organizations and individuals in theUnited States, including the American Friends Service Committee inPhiladelphia, a Quaker group, and World Vision, a Monrovia, Calif.,Christian agency. Increasingly, Vietnam veterans are lending a hand.   Seven American plastic surgeons and two other physicians, thefirst group of American doctors to work in Vietnam since the end ofthe war, operated on 101 children in February to correct mouthdeformities, including cleft lips, as part of ``Operation Smile,''a Norfolk, Va., based charitable agency.   ``Every time I come, I bring them a couple of thousand dollarsworth of sutures,'' says Constable of Massachusetts General. ``Theygo very fast.''   `It's a social economic problem, not only a medical problem,''says Dr. Tran Ngoc Manh, a vice director of Pedatric Hospital No.1, which cares for children from birth to age 15 in Ho Chi MinhCity and 14 provinces to the south.	</TEXT><NOTE>By GUY COATES</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>EUNICE, La. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The foot-stomping and fiddling inside the oldEunice vaudeville theater spoke of a packed house for the Cajunversion of Prairie Home Companion.   They lined up around the block, ignoring a tornado watch andgully-washing rain to purchase tickets for a show where no Englishwas spoken except for brief opening remarks by a uniformed parkranger.   For more than a year now, the crowds have been filling the700-seat Liberty Theater every Saturday night for a live two-hourshow broadcast locally, regionally and at several points in thenation on a delayed basis.   The music, the humor and the recitations of spicy recipes byguest chefs are in Cajun French, which is based on a language spokenin the 18th century.   The Acadians were exiled from Nova Scotia by the British in 1755and 10 years later many had found their way to the swampy coasts andinland prairies of south Louisiana. Others went to inland Canada andMaine.   ``The tape of this show is being sent to public radio in Maineand New Brunswick,'' says Mayor Curtis Joubert, who led a localmovement to save the three-story brick Liberty Theater fromdestruction once it finally closed as a movie house in 1982.   Built in 1924, the Liberty was the tiny town's chief window intoa world filled with vaudeville comedians, actors, singers andultimately the movies.   Joubert, a retired high school principal and veteran politician,sweet-talked the citizens into buying the building. Next, he usedhis charms on the National Park Service, which entered into a jointventure with Eunice.   Town residents helped restore the gaudy grandeur of the oldtheater, tearing down rotted curtains that had covered originalceiling-to-floor murals, one a painted Carmen dancing with atambourine. Moldings were regilded, chandeliers cleaned and floorsscrubbed of more than 50 years of accumulated wax and dirt,revealing sparkling green-and-white ceramic-pieced floors.   An old organ with wooden pipes, now valued by the HistoricalOrgan Society at $25,000, was found under a pile of debris.   The theater is part of the Jean Lafitte National Park, which is aseries of places scattered around south Louisiana, including the NewOrleans French Quarter.   Construction was set to begin earlier this month on a $3 millionAcadian Culture Center, adjacent to the theater. It is scheduled toopen sometime next year.   The Jean Lafitte National Park chose the Liberty Theater as asite for an interpretive center for the Prairie Cajun culture. Thecity signed a cooperative agreement with the National Park Servicewhich uses the theater for its living history presentations.   ``That the city of Eunice is now the site for a national parkboggles the minds of many of the people in this rural area,''Joubert says.   Also, a state-of-the-art sound system is being installed thatwill allow larger radio stations to air the program.   ``They demand quality sound and we'll have it,'' Joubert says.   The heart of the Liberty is the ``Rendez-Vous Des Cajuns,'' whichfeatures Cajun bands, from the famous to youngsters just gettingstarted on the traditional sound that was isolated along with theFrench heritage until the late 1960s.   ``In my generation we were spanked at school if we spokeFrench,'' recalls Joubert. ``There was a sense of shame in beingCajun. We kept the music to ourselves.''   In less than 20 years, the state has brought back that heritagewith a bang, offering French courses in elementary schools with manyteachers from France. Chefs have traveled the world touting the food.   No one represents the new wave of Cajun culture better than Dr.Barry Ancelet, the 37-year-old humorist who hosts the show, boastsJoubert.   Ancelet is a specialist in folklore at the University ofSouthwestern Louisiana and did his doctoral dissertation on Cajunhumor.   ``I would die in English because the tone of voice, the melodyand the vocal pattern are so important in humor,'' Ancelet says.``The humor here is not the slick Johnny Carson type. It's moreearthy and rural. There's a lot of hunting and fishing stories. Andhere they poke fun at prominent people in the community.''   When the show started in the summer of 1987, Ancelet says he waspleasantly surprised to find that the 20 percent to 25 percent ofthe audience who didn't speak the language were laughing.   ``We'll get someone in from Wyoming or Tennessee who will nudgethe fellow next to him and ask what I said. The Cajun must beinterpreting well because the tourist laughs. They'll get into aconversation, get to know each other. There's a twofold victoryhere. The tourist gets his money's worth. He came down here to seeCajun culture. In the Liberty, he talks with them, dances with them.The Cajun sees that his native knowledge is thereby valued. He feelsgood about himself.''   Ancelet says he sees the show as an extension of his classroom.   ``I call it guerrilla academics. I have the opportunity to talkto 700 people and while they are being entertained I get to slipinformation to them about who they are, where they came from, whythey are the way they are.''   The show stirs some of the younger people, especially musicians,to learn the French language.   ``The musicians are learning that it's not just enough to mouthFrench words,'' Ancelet says. ``They need to understand what thewords mean to make the song live.''   A local committee whose members' identities are kept secret toavoid pressure chooses the bands for each show from a long list ofapplicants.   ``The committee tries to encourage new talent and yet bring inthe well-known bands from time to time,'' the mayor says. ``We'llnever run out of musicians.''   Until the Liberty Theater opened, the younger generation didn'tget much opportunity to hear Cajun music because the bands wereperforming in nightclubs, he says.   ``We've been portrayed so many times as a bunch of drunks fallingoff horses at Mardi Gras,'' he says. ``Here's a soft drink andpopcorn crowd on Saturday night, a family-oriented crowd enjoyinglife and the good things we have to offer in Acadiana.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By GUY COATES</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>OPELOUSAS, La. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rachel Thompson had never tasted shrimp inher native Louisiana, which is famous for its seafood, and RonnieEmonet had never heard the wind moan through the piney hills of hisown state.   Both are 16 and represent the best hope for dismantling a wall ofmistrust built generations ago by two clashing cultures, says CaroleAndrepont of Opelousas, who turned a joke into a serious experimentthat worked.   Andrepont, a member of the Louisiana Tourism Board who has beenactive in international youth exchange programs for years, jokinglytold a friend one day, ``If you want to have a real culturalexchange, have folks from north Louisiana come to south Louisiana.It's like two different countries.''   An almost visible line across the center of Louisiana separatesthe staid upstate Protestants from the Catholic Cajuns, who maketime for work around a busy schedule of consuming the full cup oflife.   The descendants of the exiles from Nova Scotia make up a third ofthe state's population and those of different ancestry living insouth Louisiana have absorbed the laid-back lifestyle of the Cajuns.   Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, the first French-speaking Catholicelected to the state's highest office this century, says thedivision is more a perception than anything else, but ``a perceptioncan be real.''   ``The barrier exists in the minds of those who have not had theopportunity to visit one end of the state or the other,'' he says.``But, invariably when they do, they come away with an amazement ofhow much in common they have.''   ``The barrier is exaggerated but it's there,'' adds Gov. BuddyRoemer, whose family plantation is not far from the Arkansas borderin north Louisiana.   ``A real factor has been a lack of quality transportation. It'shard to get from upstate Shreveport to New Orleans. In fact, it'seasier to get from Shreveport to Dallas.''   Edwards and Roemer agree that an exchange program aimed at youthscan eventually erase the perception.   The idea for the exchange program gnawed at Andrepont and finallyshe talked with Linda Graham, her Ruston counterpart at a tourismmeeting in Baton Rouge.   ``I told her I had an idea about two cities having an exchangeprogram and the more we looked at it, the more we liked it,'' shesays. ``We talked to our mayors, school officials and civic leaders.Now, we've done it.''   In a recently ended two-week program, about 20 Ruston high schoolstudents spent a week in Opelousas and an equal number of the southLouisiana students stayed in Ruston.   Host families provided homes and meals, treating their guestslike their own kids, Andrepont says.   The mayors and civic leaders visited each other's municipalitiesand, like the kids, discovered that even with the culturaldifferences, people are just folks and get different views of whatthey see, depending on personalities.   ``The people are more free, more open down here,'' says Rachel,who attends Ruston High School. ``Up north, we're very polite, butdown here...   ``I called my mom and said I was staying here another two weeks.She just laughed.''   ``I like Ruston better than here,'' says Telameckus Anderson, a16-year-old junior at Opelousas High School. ``They're so nice. Thehills are beautiful.''   ``The family I stayed with made me feel like we were related,''says Emonet, a junior at Opelousas Catholic.   Asked if they laughed at his Cajun accent, Emonet said, ``Thegirls thought it was cute. I laughed at their drawls. We laughedwith each other.''   Graham says she learned something important from her visit tosouth Louisiana:   ``I need to go home and loosen up a bit. We're more conservativein Ruston and we are organized. I find myself regimented to thepoint where I get a little bit irritated when everything doesn't gojust like clockwork.   ``I learned to relax. I need to come down here about once amonth.''   Andrepont, meanwhile, says Cajuns can learn from the otherlifestyles, maybe find a middle ground.   ``Everything we do is almost overdone,'' she says. ``When we eat,it's a lot and the best. If it's seasoned, it's highly seasoned.People who drink, they drink.''   Graham and Andrepont say the two cities are going to conduct suchprograms each year and encourage other communities to do the samething.   ``I think this is going to be a state program,'' Andrepont says.``We've got Church Point interested in finding a north Louisianacity for an exchange program. The governor is interested. We need toend the division in this state. The 40 youngsters in this programdon't have the old attitude anymore. It works.''   Roemer, the governor, says, ``This is the first of several suchprograms that will happen over the next year. One of the issues inmy campaign was the need for all of the state to pull together.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On the day before Christmas, some 2 millionpeople rushed to airports across America, expecting turmoil ordelays. They often found both.   That kind of airport crush, now usually seen only on Thanksgivingand Christmas, is likely to become commonplace by the year 2000 whenthe airlines expect to carry nearly 800 million passengers a year,an average of more than 2 million every day.   Hello, gridlock.   Yes, aviation officials are beginning to worry about a logjam inthe air.   Once the domain of businessmen and the well-heeled, the airlineshave become a mass transit system. A record 455 million passengersboarded commercial aircraft in 1988, nearly 1.2 million people aday, compared to 243 million in l977.   Three of every 10 adults took an airline flight last year, andnearly three of every four adults had flown at some point in theirlives.   Yet, no major new airports have been built since 1974, when theDallas-Fort Worth airport was constructed on 18,000-acres of Texasprairie. And while local officials have received agreement on amassive, futuristic $3 billion airport at Denver, the airlines therehave balked because of the cost.   Add to that an air traffic control system still struggling torecover from a 1981 strike, plus federal budget constraints.   The holiday passenger crunch ``gives us all a glimpse into thefuture of air traffic,'' bemoans Herbert Kelleher, chairman ofSouthwest Airlines. He says the air transport system of today``lacks the capacity to handle that volume of traffic on a dailybasis.'' He also says there are scant signs that anything is beingdone about it.   ``I think the single biggest concern in aviation is the capacityissue,'' agrees John Lauber, a member of the National TransportationSafety Board.   The traffic demands also raise safety worries, he says,especially since it is unlikely that dozens of new runways andairports will be constructed and broad modernization of the airtraffic control system is years away.   ``There are real questions as to how we are going to accommodatethis growth,'' Lauber warns.   He acknowledges that there are ways to solve the congestionproblem short of pouring new concrete. But, he says, ``the danger isthat these things will be done before all of the ramifications arethought through from a safety standpoint. The pressure is there.''   Among the short-term solutions being considered by the FederalAviation Administration are adopting new technology to allow moreplanes to land in a shorter time span and increasing use ofcomputers to predict traffic flow.   Indeed, the overcrowding is being felt both in the air and on theground.   Seventeen airports used by 40 percent of the flying public wereclassified in 1988 as ``seriously congested'' because they handled160 percent of the traffic for which they were designed. By the year2000 that number could go as high as 58 airports used by nearlythree out of every four travelers, according to the FAA.   Officials at Boston's Logan International Airport say as far asthey're concerned aviation gridlock already has arrived.   Last summer, the Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan,imposed a new fee structure that makes it too expensive for ownersof small planes and even some commuter airlines to land. The localofficials argue that in an era of scarce resources priority must begiven to large jetliners carrying hundreds of people.   The federal Transportation Department has called the action aninterference with national commerce and threatens to withholdfederal airport funds if the fees are not reversed. The Loganofficials, meanwhile, are standing firm and intend to fight the DOTruling in court.   The FAA is still trying to recover from the 1981 strike by airtraffic controllers in which 11,400 were fired and had to bereplaced by inexperienced recruits. While senior managers have drawnup new flight patterns and adopted a system of central ``flowcontrol'' to better manage airspace with fewer controllers, problemspersist.   Only last fall, controllers at Chicago's busy O'HareInternational Airport began making errors so frequently that thefederal government ordered a cut in flights. As a result, the numberof delays jumped.   Furthermore, the agency's seven-year focus on damage control andgovernment-wide budget constraints have delayed for several yearsthe long-range modernization of its air traffic control system.   The overhauled system is now scheduled for completion in the late1990s at a cost of $16 billion to $24 billion.   But many airline executives complain that the capacity crunch isalready here.   ``We tend to be making a conscious effort to do everythingpossible to restrain the transportation system that lies at the coreof travel and tourism,'' complains Robert Crandall, chairman ofAmerican Airlines.   Problems with air traffic control and restrictions of variouskinds already stifle competition, he argues.   ``Today, American can't compete with Eastern, Pan Am or DonaldTrump (who recently bought the Eastern shuttle) between Washingtonand New York. We can't add flights to and from Chicago, nor can weoperate the ones we already have there with the slightest assurancethat they will either arrive or leave on time.   ``Even in Nashville our flights often sit on the ground waitingfor a slot in the sky. The reality is we are making air travelharder and harder rather than making it easier and easier.''   The airlines for more than a year have warned of impending chaos.But a $15 million grass-roots campaign to persuade business andpolitical leaders to push for new airport capacity has so farproduced little.   ``I don't see a hell of a lot of difference between our aviationproblems a year ago and our aviation problems today except todaythey are worse,'' Crandall said at a recent industry conference.   The industry is especially critical of the government's handlingof the billions of dollars that are collected each year through an 8percent ticket tax. The money goes into a special trust fund, but inrecent years much more went in than has come out.	</TEXT><NOTE>By HENRY STERN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CLINTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Convicted child killer Elizabeth DianeDowns, who describes herself as the most hated woman in America,giggles nervously as she talks of her plans to marry a former policeofficer from Oregon.   The 33-year-old former mail carrier, one of Oregon's mostnotorious criminals of modern times, also smiles a lot when shetalks about a new book about her trial which is due out this spring.   Ms. Downs was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years forkilling her 7-year-old daughter and wounding her two other childrenon a rural road outside Springfield, Ore., on May 19, 1983. Anappeal of the conviction was set aside without comment on Jan. 4.   She was transferred to the Correctional Institution for Women inNew Jersey after she escaped in July 1987 by scaling a fence at theOregon Women's Correctional Center in Salem. She remained at largefor 10 days until she was found with a group of men less than a milefrom the prison.   Prison authorities believe she has less chance of escaping in NewJersey because she doesn't know anybody here and she would have noplace to run.   Prison guards at Clinton say Ms. Downs keeps to herself, butassociates say she thrives on publicity. As one guard put it, ``Thelast thing her ego needs is another interview.''   ``She sees a camera and her whole world brightens,'' says AnnRule, a Seattle-based author whose book, ``Small Sacrifices'' aboutthe Downs case rode the best-seller list of The New York Times for25 weeks this year.   ``I don't believe she has any emotion for her children beyond thefact that they're her possession and somebody took them away fromher.''   Prosecutors charged that the children were shot because Ms. Downsbelieved they interfered in her relationship with a boyfriend whodid not want to be a father.   Ms. Downs contends that a stranger flagged down her car shot herand the children. She was wounded by a single bullet in the left arm.   ``What happened the night of the shooting was so horrendous, sounexpected, so unbelievable,'' Ms. Downs said in a recent jailhouseinterview. ``I'm very self-disciplined and I need to have control ofmy own existence. I just reached a point of not knowing what wasreal and what wasn't.''   Cheryl Lynn Downs, 7, was killed. Fourteen year-old Christie Annwas left handicapped in her speech, 9-year-old Danny is paralyzedfrom the waist down. The lead prosecutor in the case, Lane CountyAssistant District Attorney Fred Hugi, adopted the children.   Ms. Downs says she spends her time exchanging letters with hernew fiance, whom she described as a former police officer who sawher on ``The Oprah Winfrey show'' and wrote her because he feltsorry for her.   ``Anybody who would want to be involved with the most hated womanin America must be a nut,'' Ms. Downs says. ``But he's not a wacko.He's genuine.''   She declines to indentify the man except that he's a formerOregon police officer who has since moved to New Jersey.   ``I'm lucid. I've been married before and I said I never would doit again. But I'm in love,'' said Ms. Downs, who was married foreight years to Steve Downs, an electrician and farm laborer.   Kim White, a state Corrections Department spokeswoman, confirmedthat Ms. Downs has asked the department for permission to marry theman. Ms. White also would not identify him.   She said the couple are in the preliminary stages of applying forpermission to marry. They still must meet with the prison chaplainand obtain the approval of the superintendent who submits therequest to a committee for a recommendation.   New Jersey does not permit conjugal visits, she added.   Ms. Downs, who earned an associate's degree in general studieswhile imprisoned in Oregon, has also completed a book, ``Best-KeptSecrets,'' scheduled for release in April by Danmark Publishing,based in Springfield, Ore. About 75 percent of the 350-page bookwill be direct quotes from the trial transcript, Ms. Downs said.   A spokesman for Danmark says that any profits from the book willgo to the state of Oregon under a law passed in the wake of theDowns case.   Its release surely will spark more discussion of the case, butMs. Downs says she doesn't believe her children will suffer ifpeople talk about her case.   ``How could the truth hurt the kids?'' Ms. Downs says. ``I get sofrustrated when I hear things like that...How can the truth hurtanybody unless they're a liar?''   But Ms. Rule says the truth that she observed in the nine-monthtrial was a guilty Ms. Downs, who was pregnant at the time withanother child, who was later put up for adoption.   ``I've never seen anyone as manipulative as Diane,'' Ms. Rulesays, describing her as ``sociopathic, histrionic and narcissistic.''   ``I think she knows what she did,'' Ms. Rule says. ``The truth isburied so deep that she doesn't have to think about it. She's notcrazy though.''   But Ms. Downs denies her guilt and says the bonds between her andher children remain.   ``They're part of my body that broke away,'' she says. ``Theylove me but at the same time they're uncomfortable with ever beingwith me again.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>DRUMCLIFF, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fifty years after his death, touristsby the busload and in a procession of rental cars pay scant heed tothe epitaph William Butler Yeats had carved on his tombstone in thelittle churchyard here:   ``Cast a cold eye   ``On life, on death.   ``Horseman, pass by!''   Last year, 50,000 visitors from as far away as Japan andAustralia trooped into the Church of Ireland graveyard ``under bareBen Bulben's head,'' the flattopped mountain that like a huge grandpiano with the lid down echoes the winds and waves of the wildAtlantic. Some carried well-thumbed volumes by the Nobel laureateregarded by many as the sublimest poet of the English language sinceMilton.   ``Even on the foulest, wettest day, if I leave the church open,someone is sure to come by and sign the guest book,'' says the Rev.Robert Hayman, an American from San Francisco by way of Seattle whois rector of St. Columba's, the rural Protestant parish where Yeats'great-grandfather had served.   Record numbers are expected for this year's semicentennialobservance of the poet's death. In August, scholars and lecturersfrom around the world will gather for the 30th session of the YeatsInternational Summer School.   For something to write postcards home about besides ``the mostwild and beautiful scenery under a sky ever loaded and fantasticwith flying clouds,'' as Yeats described it, there is renewedcontroversy over whether the poet actually lies beneath the epitaphhe composed four months before his death in 1939. For certain, hiswife is buried there, memorialized by a smaller stone engraved``George,'' which also mystifies visitors.   ``Like a plague of locusts, that question of the wrong body inthe grave comes up every seven years,'' scoffed Aengus Cantwell,president-elect of the Council of the Yeats Society, whichadministers his library and memorial in the old Royal Bank buildingin Sligo. ``Willie probably would have enjoyed this morbid joke onhimself, but it's very distasteful for his son, Michael, anddaughter, Anne, to have to go through it all over again.''   Yeats in declining health sought the warmth of the FrenchRiviera, where he died on Jan. 28, 1939. The outbreak of World WarII delayed compliance with his wish to be buried at Drumcliff, sohis casket was taken to the little cemetery at Roquebrune on theheights overlooking Menton and Monaco in the shadow of the Alps.   Rumors of what happened there resurfaced last fall when Britishbiographer Diana Souhami was researching the life of Dutch painterHannah Gluck, a close friend of Yeats. She reported finding``letters from the priest in Roquebrune and the undertakers''casting doubt on who was buried where. Her version has GeorgieYeats, the poet's widow, consigning his remains to a temporarygrave, which she thought would remain untouched for at least 10years. Instead, claimed the writer, he was buried in a paupers'grave ``with four or five others,'' which was cleared in 1946 and``all the bones placed in a common ossuary.''   Biographer Souhami said artist Gluck and journalist Edith Healdvisited Roquebrune a year later and ``were shocked to find no traceof Yeats' grave.'' Gluck had friends write to the priest, whoreplied that it would be possible to identify the poet's remains``if we empty the entire contents of the ossuary and if we havedetails of distinctive characteristics which will enable us toreconstruct the skeleton after painstaking research carried outunder the direction of a medical expert.''   But, according to Souhami, ``Yeats' purported remains wereexhumed and shipped to Ireland just one month later _ much too soonto enable the bones to be indentified'' with scientific precision.   In a letter to the Irish Times, Michael Yeats, a member of theIrish Senate like his father, denounced her claims as ``the greatestnonsense.'' He insisted his mother had overlooked the wholeoperation and the remains were measured. ``It is absolutely certainthat my father is buried in County Sligo,'' he wrote. ``I have thedocumentation to prove it.''   All of which keeps alive a bizarre and macabre tale of the sortWilliam Butler Yeats would have relished hearing from the farmersand fishermen around Sligo Bay and retelling in glorious, ghoulishdetail in his folk collection titled ``Mythologies.'' Even thereburial of Yeats at a grand state funeral is an enduring chapter inthe oral history of Ireland's wild west.   The American critic Hugh Kenner found this out when heinterviewed the locals more than three decades after that Septembermorning in 1948 when the Irish gunboat Macha brought the remains toGalway harbor ``whence they bumped to Sligo, past knots ofschoolchildren standing mute with their teachers, along roads neverbuilt for a poet's gliding.''   He was told ``for a fact'' how ``the coffin was a substitutefilled with stones, how drunken sailors let the original slide intothe unplumbed Mediterranean; also how the Macha ran aground in Sligoharbor before being diverted to Galway, and how her load, whetherstones or lead-encased bones, instantly broke the hearse's springs.''   It's almost a tale told by ``Silly Willie himself,'' as Cantwellsaid Sligo people still characterize the poet from his habit ofwalking solitary and often barefoot along the strand at RossesPoint, through the woods of Lissadell, on the lake isle ofInnisfree, up tortuous trails to the barren heights of Ben Bulbenand Knocknarea and the other childhood haunts that echo in hislovely lines.   Yeats was born in Dublin, lived much of his life in London anddied in France. Yet he always regarded Sligo, where he spent everyboyhoood summer, as his home. His barrister father gave up law tobecome a painter. His brother, Jack, was Ireland's leading artist.   His mother's side of the family, the seafaring Middletons andPollexfens, were steamboat captains, smugglers and eventuallyprosperous ship owner's on whom a poor poet could always depend fora free passage home from Liverpool.	</TEXT><NOTE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The jazz funeral is making a comeback. For$1,200, more or less, the Olympia Brass Band will wail you out tothe graveyard, slow and sad, then cut you loose in ragtime and let``The Saints Go Marching In.''   The more or less depends on the location of the cemetery.   ``In New Orleans, the overground vaults are just about full, sowe got to go by van to cemeteries out in the suburbs,'' says HaroldDejan, who for 30 years has mournfully swayed and strutted with theword ``leader'' stamped in gold on his black funeral cap. ``Butwe'll go anywhere. We just played a funeral in Hattiesburg, Miss.Young girl called me and said her daddy so wanted to go that way. Afarmer up in Minnesota has got us written into his will. Lots offolks have.''   Just turned 80, Dejan is delighted at an upsurge in burialbusiness from a younger generation that once scorned Dixieland as``Uncle Tom's tom-tom.''   ``Everything is lovely,'' he drawls (frequently). ``Funerals arepicking up again. Sometimes we do two, three a week. Black, white,pink, purple, it makes no difference. We play for anyone who asks.   ``Years ago, I did three funerals in a day. The lodges andbenevolent societies all had burial policies. Some folks joinedjust so's they'd have a band at their funeral. It came with a $50policy.   ``We'd march out to the graveyard, then parade the organizationback for $1.50 or $2. The leader got an extra dollar. Now with theunion I'd have to pay my men $40 or $50 for that same funeral, andthe leader gets double.''   Live business is even better. Besides playing weddings,baptisms, French Quarter nightclubs, steamboat cruises, Mardi Grasparades and balls, the old funeral bands are hard pressed to keepin step with the conventions coming to New Orleans and the fad forjazz breakfasts and luncheons at hotels and restaurants.   ``The growth of the hospitality industry makes it tough to get aband together around here,'' says talent agent Harry Mayronne, whohelps the Olympia with out-of-town bookings.   The band has made 28 European trips, played for several heads ofstate and every president since Lyndon Johnson. It has appeared inmovies like the James Bond film ``Live and Let Die'' and donnedwhite caps and gloves to welcome Pope John Paul II at the NewOrleans airport.   ``Jazz, jazz,'' the music-loving pontiff exclaimed as Dejan'salto sax wailed the counterpoint on ``Lord, Lord, You Sure BeenGood To Me,'' his theme song. Also, he avows, ``the story of mylife.''   Dejan's father _ ``the biggest drayman in New Orleans'' _ gavehim a clarinet for his 8th birthday, but his love of music camefrom his mother, who had heard Jenny Lind and Adelina Patti at theFrench opera house.   When his brother Leo got a gold trumpet _ ``the doctorrecommended it after taking out his tonsils'' _ Dejan wanted a goldsaxophone. ``But Daddy said that would cost twice as much, so Istarted work at the Japanese Gardens out in Milenberg the next weekand paid for that sax in three months.''   In his living room cluttered with trophies, old band hats andfaded snapshots, memories of those dance pavilions and speak-easiesout on Lake Pontchartrain glitter like the diamond in Jelly RollMorton's front tooth:   ``Milneberg Joys'' from a barrelhouse piano. Kid Ory pumping upa trombone storm over those bootlegger boats bobbing at anchor. BigFoot Philips on drums. Papa Celestin's horn airborne on ``SouthRampart Street Parade.''   Dejan was 12 years old when he worked at the Japanese Gardens.   ``Hey, son, buy you a drink?''   ``Whiskey, I'd order, and the boss would pour me some cola in aJapanese teacup and put 50 cents aside. Only made $2 a night, butthe tips were great. They hired me because most of them catscouldn't read music.''   Dejan was still in short pants and hid a tuxedo under the porchto sneak off after dark to the College Inn in Storyville, thosefabled 38 blocks set aside by alderman Sidney Story for sin andsyncopation.   ``Buy you a drink, baby? Gals say `sure' then dump it into a tincan under the table. At Mahogany Hall, you took off your shoes.Didn't dare scratch up that beautiful floor.''   Dejan's gaze rested on a yellowing photograph of trumpeterMilton Batiste, his assistant leader, with Louis Armstrong and KingOliver. ``I call them the three kings. I remember the night Louisleft Tom Anderson's annex on the corner to go with Oliver inChicago.''   Later Sidney Bechet went off to join Josephine Baker's ``RevueNegre'' and became the toast of Paris. The sweet silver of hissoprano sax echoed in classical fugues by jazz buff IgorStravinsky. Bechet's brother Leonard, ``a good dentist and finetrombonist,'' stayed behind and rendered jazz a singular service.   Dejan told how trumpet great Bunk Johnson lost his lip and wasreduced to chopping sugar cane, until Leonard ``rejuvenated himwith a new set of choppers.''   Dixieland evolved from two cultural strains in old New Orleans.First came ``gens de couleur,'' free people of color, who were theartisans and shopkeepers in the days of French and Spanish rule.Military bands were the vogue, and the aristocracy kept Creolemistresses in maisonettes in the ``Vieux Carre,'' the old quarter,and showed them off at elegant quadroon balls.	</TEXT><NOTE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For centuries the pope was an Italian who got aroundmainly in a chair toted by six other Italians.   Now Pope John Paul II ranks as the world's number-onejet-setter, a supersonic pilgrim whose frequent-flyer mileage onmore than 40 journeys outside Italy would take him to the moon andhalfway back.   Across 400,000 miles in a little over a decade, the pope fromPoland has carried his pastoral cross to 82 countries _ fromArgentina to Zimbabwe, from Tromso, Norway, only l,375 miles fromthe North Pole, to Tasmania, at the bottom of Australia, fromancient Izmir to modern Brasilia.   British historian Paul Johnson says that in assuming the ``widerrole of high priest of the planet'' John Paul has been seen inperson by ``the largest concentrations of human beings in thehistory of the world.''   No rock group, no politician, no sports star has out-drawn thisformer actor with the prizefighter's face, craggy eyebrows andpenetrating blue eyes who has ventured beyond Michelangelo'smagnificent dome to play the Superdome, the Silverdome, the LosAngeles Coliseum and soccer stadiums, bullrings and race tracks onsix continents.   Two photojournalists, Luciano Mellace, who has been on all ofJohn Paul's trips, and Giancarlo Giuliana, who has missed only one,sometimes argue with the other boys in the back of the Vatican'schartered jet about the biggest single crowd they ever saw.   Was it that 200-acre former dueling ground in Dublin's PhoenixPark carpeted in every direction from the open-air altar withalmost half of Ireland's 4 million population?   Or that billowing sea of bowing bodies stretching beyond thereach of their longest lens from the shrine of the Black Madonna atJasna Gora in Poland?   Or those endless files of the faithful marching like armies ofants up the heights of Santa Anna Mountain after the Polishgovernment failed to provide the promised buses, canceled trainsand even closed highways?   Or perhaps the nearly 3 million Mexicans who lined the roadsfrom the presidential palace to the shrine of Our Lady ofGuadalupe, picking up the paving stones where he passed?   These days no one around the Vatican seems to know what becameof the sedia gestatoria, the portable throne air-conditioned byhand-waved flabella, ostrich feathers, that for centuries was themain mode of papal transport.   ``Probably in a storeroom at the Vatican Museum,'' venturedJesuit Sesto Quercetti, program director of Vatican Radio, whoalready is planning the October trip to Indonesia and Korea.   Others are tutoring the pope in Bahasa, the official language ofIndonesia, preparing cassettes for him to listen to while shavingor late at night after the last visitor has left.   At ``total immersion'' lunches they perfect his pronunciationand go over his speeches the way Swedish Jesuit Lars Rooth coachedhim for that June jaunt beyond the Arctic Circle.   Although Scandinavia's Catholic population of 200,000 adds up toonly a moderate turnout for his noon Sunday blessing in St. Peter'sSquare, John Paul added five new languages to his repertoire:Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish and Icelandic.   ``As it was for the Twelve Apostles, language is a key tool forhim spreading the message of Jesus,'' Rooth says of thisperipatetic pope who is fluent in nine languages and has preachedin 40 others, including Swahili, Tagolog , Bengali, Huron andpidgin. ``He has a marvelous ear. Danish and Icelandic aredevilishly difficult.''   Vaticanisti, the scribes in the baroque press room at the end ofBernini's columns, knew a rare linguist was in residence in thethird-floor papal apartment when, on the morning after hiselection, the pope asked a Swiss guard in German the way to theelevator, then received the diplomatic corps in faultless French,conferred with Curia cardinals in perfect Italian, lunched with aSpanish bishop, dictated letters in English to Fr. John Magee, hisIrish secretary, and at dinner sang sad folk songs with old friendsfrom the nearby Polish College where he still keeps his guitar andskis in a closet.   Several Good Fridays ago, John Paul II quietly relieved a priesthearing confessions in St. Peter's and for several hours absolvedpenitents in Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish and Ukranian. Two monthsof intensive study enabled him to answer questions from students onJapanese TV.   For months now a team of routing experts at Alitalia'sheadquarters in Eur, outside Rome, has been working out details ofthe upcoming Asia trip with other national airlines involved andvisiting each country in advance with Vatican officals.   ``Getting the Holy Father on the road is a full-time job. Webegin planning seven to eight months ahead,'' says Pietro Canale,director of Alitalia's office of Vatican Relations, who has beenaboard every papal plane since Paul VI went to the Holy Land in1964. ``Some airlines are very efficient.   ``The pope is not a very demanding passenger. He has yet to askfor special treatment or any favorite food. There is no designatedpapal jet. We use whichever jumbo is next in rotation. The sameapplies to the crew, except an extra officer is added in thecockpit and to the cabin staff.''   It now takes but a few hours to re-configure a Boeing 747 for apapal trip, fitting out the upstairs ``bubble'' with acurtained-off bedroom, a tiny dining alcove and a small office witha table and two chairs, then affixing the papal coat of arms to theright of the door.   First-class fare is put aboard _ smoked salmon, caviar, beefWellington, estate bottled wines _ to be enjoyed mainly by thejournalists and the entourage of cardinals and bishops. The popehas a robust appetite, but since he was shot in the abdomen duringan assassination attempt in St. Peter's Square in May 198l, he eatsmore sparingly.	</TEXT><NOTE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The frequency of John Paul II's journeys andtightened security have cut down the crowds. The paparazzi, Rome'saggressive free-lance photographers, no longer book seats on thepapal charter now that the Vatican videotapes all the trips.   But there has been no letup in the blizzard of souvenir buttons,T-shirts, key rings, posters, cardboard miters or pope hats andsimilar sentimental schlock littering the papal path.   Dublin vendors hawked ``I Peeked at the Pope'' buttons that alsopeeked back from a portrait of John Paul II with eyes that seemedto move.   Merchants in Hamtramck, Detroit's Polish neighborhood, offeredpapal beer mugs adorned with his familiar profile. Food stalls inLos Angeles pushed ``pope-corn'' and ``pope-sicles.''   In Carmel, Calif., John Paul II shared billing with ``DirtyHarry,'' played by Mayor Clint Eastwood, on a T-shirt lettered inmedieval script, ``Thou Hast Made My Day.''   The Vatican press in revolution-scarred El Salvador woreT-shirts emblazoned with the strange device:``No dispare!Periodista Bendecido Por El Papa'' _ Don't shoot! Journalistblessed by the pope.   The pope was welcomed back to his home diocese of Kracow with,``Witamy, Jan Pawel'' _ welcome John Paul _ buttons that showed himgiving a trendy high five in a choice of Vatican yellow and whiteor Communist red and white. Warsaw balconies sprouted squat plasterstatues of the pope that suggested he had put on a few kilos sincegoing to Rome.   African mask-makers in Gabon carved amazing likenesses of theHoly Father.   Marvel Comics, which gave us Capt. Marvel and Spiderman, had awinner with a factual, well-drawn ``Life of John Paul II.''   A London theater impressario took advantage of his visit tomount a West End production of ``The Goldsmith's Shop,'' a play thepope wrote just after being elevated to the bishopric.   In New Orleans, the portable outhouses were dubbed ``vati-cans''and ``pope johns,'' and a toothless, helmeted gridiron behemothgrinned from a poster proclaiming, ``The Pope Loves the Saints'' _the name, of course, of the local pro football team.   But Miami took the cake in papal schlock with ``Let Us Spray''lawn sprinkers that asperged the grass with a jet of water from thefluttering hands of a puppet pope. It was the kind of compulsivekitsch that the pastor of one parish right along the path of thepopemobile could not resist.	</TEXT><NOTE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>ST. MARTINVILLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hunched over his accordion in theshade of a live oak tree, Lennis Romero was letting his ethnic prideshow.   ``Cher, it don't surprise me one tam bit that Cajun food is abig, yeah, in London, Holland and Russia,'' he says. ``The rest ofthe world just been a 'ti slow in catching up with the good thingsin life.''   Lennis and his brother, Ophe, a virtuoso on the 'ti fer, ortriangle, had just stomped out ``Jambalaya'' for some ``foreignFrench'' tourists who arrived on the banks of Bayou Teche in a busmarked ``un voyage au vrai pays des Acadiens,'' a trip to the realCajun country.   Me oh, my oh, Cajun culture has busted out of the bayou and goneglobal. Suddenly last summer, crawfish etouffee and file gumbo wereon the menu at the summit in Moscow. Amsterdam's hottest newrestaurant is Riekje Sluizer's Cajun Louisiana Kitchen, ``geopendvoor lunch.'' London has two Cajun-style restaurants and liberaldoses of sauce piquant are spicing up traditionally bland Britishcuisine at such posh nosheries as Wilton's and the Savoy Grill.   Now busloads of European tourists, led by the French, areventuring deep into the bayous where before World War II paved roadsseldom penetrated.   As Ophe conceded, there was a 'ti language problem at first. TheRomero brothers speak quaint French that like the meandering bayouhas been bent out of shape in the last two centuries. But once thevisitors from Paris and Lyons figured out that 'ti was Cajun forpetit and that an alligator was neither un caiman nor un crocodile,they were able to communicate their desire to sample ``soupe decocodrie.''   In St. Martinville, the spiritual capital of Cajun-land, the tourgroup posed for photos around the statue of ``Evangeline,'' theheroine of Longfellow's epic about the British expulsion of Frenchsettlers from Acadia, or Nova Scotia, in 1755. Then in the oldIndian cemetery, they saw the grave of Emmeline Labiche, whosereal-life separation from her lover inspired the poem.   Like Americans cramming into the Crazy Horse Saloon in Paris, theFrench contingent braved the overflow crowd at Mulate's, the Cajunnightclub in Breaux Bridge, for a fais do-do, literally ``make go tosleep,'' the Saturday night dance named for the tiny room wheresmall children dozed while their parents two-stepped until dawn.   Cajun music, like Cajun cooking, is echoing around the world.Bayou artists such as fiddler Michael Doucet and pianist ZacharyRichard have rabid fans in Paris, Montreal, Quebec, Martinique, SanFrancisco and New York's Greenwich Village. Don Montoucet's Cajuncombo had the comrades jumping when Chef John Folse from Lafitte'sLanding in Donaldsonville set up a Cajun restaurant at the MoscowWorld Trade Center at the summit in June.   If Paul Prudhomme had shown up that night at Mulate's, he wouldhave been mobbed like a young Charles Boyer for autographs by boththe locals and the French pilgrims on the trail of what theirculture has brought forth on this continent.   Prudhomme, the first American chef to be awarded the MeriteAgricole by the French government, is proprietor of K-Paul'sLouisiana Kitchen in New Orleans, a culinary superstar on TV, radioand videotapes, and the author of cookbooks that have sold more than600,000 in hardback.   He is also the author of such insights into Cajun culture as:   ``An authentic Cajun is one who anticipates the start of thecrawfish season as much as his wedding night.''   ``Good Cajun cooking doesn't taste country; it tastes grandma.''   ``If you don't hover between pleasure and pain when you eat it,chances are you haven't made your sauce piquant hot enough.''   Prudhomme popularized the ``blackening'' method of sealing in theflavor of meat and fish with intense heat, as if cooked over an openfire. Its ubiquitous popularity has produced such menu aberrationsas blackened meatloaf and blackened omeletes and has made the lowlyredfish, once snubbed in haute cuisine, an endangered species inTexas and Louisiana. Some months ago, undercover agents from theTexas Parks and Wildlife Department mounted a sting operation tofoil a ring of commercial fishermen and food wholesalers dealing inillegally caught redfish.   ``Dining out these days you don't know if that blackened menuspecial is the chef's favorite or his latest failure,'' laughs JoeCahn, who presides over the New Orleans School of Cooking whichdaily instructs nearly 100 students and was the finishing school forAndre Numan, Amsterdam's Cajun chef.   Cajun cooking has been around since the earliest exiles from NovaScotia found love at first bite of alligator tail meat, but itsdelights took a while catching on beyond the swamps of theAtchafalaya.   When Fannie Merritt Farmer collected America's best recipes forher Boston Cooking School cookbook in 1896, the word Cajun didn'tmake the index.   Even today, Antoine's in New Orleans, founded in 1840, doesn'tmention the word Cajun in its extensive menu, although ``Creole''has a half-dozen listings from ``gombo (sic) creole'' to ``poulet ala creole.'' Bernard Guste, the great-great-grandson of founderAntoine Alciatore, admits however to being ``a bit more heavy-handedwith the pepper pot to please tourists who expect Louisiana cookingto be hot, real hot, which was never the creole style.''   Prudhomme points out that ``as Louisiana food has grown inpopularity throughout the country, the distinction between Cajun andCreole has almost vanished.''   In history, the distinction is clearer. Creoles are descendedfrom aristocratic families who fled the terrors of the Frenchrevolutions, sometimes with their chefs, dressmakers and dancingmasters. They intermarried with Louisiana's Spanish settlers, whosecooking pots bubbled with spices and condiments from the Aztecs,Incas and the Caribbean. Black cooks on the plantations addedanother dimension, like okra and gumbo, both African words. Creoleculture was cavalier, gallant, refined; its cuisine elegant, subtle,rich in sauces.   Cajuns, a corruption of ``archadia,'' the name given to Canada'smaritime provinces by the explorer Verrazano on first sighting theirvirgin forests, were victims of one of this continent's worst humanrights atrocities.	</TEXT><NOTE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><TEXT>   A robotic finger fashioned from clothespins beckoned to theadmissions staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Adozen black roses arrived from an applicant who was turned down.   Yale once received a suit of chain-mail armor.   ``Staring at me from across the room right now,'' reports WorthDavid, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale, ``is a pair ofshorts imprinted with the name of our director of transferadmissions.''   A Harvard hopeful put his best foot forward by writing his essaywith a pen held between two toes, promising in the words of campuslaureate Longfellow to ``leave footprints on the sands of time.''   Another sent pictures of his 23 pairs of shoes with the caption,``To understand a person, try walking a mile in his shoes.''   Georgetown got a pair of lady's shoes, one down at the heel andworn through in the sole, the other polished and lovingly mended bya young cobbler who worked part time to finance his college dreams.   ``We get bathing suits with the Vassar logo,'' reports Vassaradmissions director James Montoya, ``lots of T-shirts and last weeksome tie-dyed underwear. The theme this year seems to be clothing,perhaps reflecting the values of this generation.''   What it definitely reflects is high school hype at its mosthopeful, kids brought up on TV glitz and puffery clamoring forprime-time notice beneath a pile of admissions folders.   Increasingly each year, the admissions staffs at nation's topschools are blitzed by a variety of bizarre stunts: computerprinted portfolios, Time magazine mock-ups proclaiming theapplicant Man or Woman of the Year, and endless coils of videotapeshowing the aspirant ice-dancing, building a sailboat, addressingthe local Rotary, performing a Vivaldi's concerto forcontra-bassoon.   The admissions officers at several of the nation's top schoolsall had hilarious, often pathetic, tales to tell of studentself-promotions. And almost all were up to the tops of theirwastepaper baskets with videotapes, which they agreed seldom madeany valid contribution to an application.   All had the same doleful message: It takes a heap of hype tooffset a mediocre academic record.   Also, there are subtle changes taking place or about to takeplace in the admissions process.   Some schools, such as Vassar and Tulane, are getting away fromthe formal interview with an applicant.   At a growing number of colleges, the well-rounded student is nowconsidered something of a square peg. As Vassar's Montoya pointsout, ``We have shifted from attracting well-rounded students tobuilding a well-rounded class.''   The challenge now is to put together a class melding studentswith extraordinary talent from different backgrounds: a promisingviolinist, a top athlete, a Shakespeare-spouting computer whiz, astreet-smart pool shark with a passion for pure math.   And, alas, alumni clout is vanishing from the admissions scene.Even if an applicant's surname can be envisioned on a new library,the verdict often is ``Goodbye, Mr.Chips.''   Often the admissions office mail brings food: fudge, fruitcakes,date-nut bread, pecan cookies, chocolates decorated with Harvard's``Veritas'' shield or Tulane's Green Wave.   Georgetown received homemade bread from a student who promised``not to loaf;'' a wedge of Wisconsin cheddar with the plea,``Help, get me out of the land of cheese,'' and an artichoke from agirl urging the committee to ``peel away the leaves of thisapplication and find the true heart of the matter.''   Lois Conrad, Tulane's dean of admissions, was sent a boomerang,painted in the school colors, asking for ``happy returns,'' and acharming music box from which a tiny car emerged pulling a ribboninscribed ``Tulane Bound'' to the tune of ``Way Down Yonder in NewOrleans.''   Vassar got a Morse Code message in a bottle which when decodedwas a cry of ``Help, I've been abandoned in a high school with anincompetent guidance counselor.'' Another candidate taped $2 to herapplication. ``Not enough to constitute a bribe,'' she explained,``but enough for a cup of coffee to relax you when you sit down toconsider my case.''   Some of the slicker public relations ploys betray the hand of anover-anxious parent, the computer skills of a secretary or businesspartner or the ``grab 'em by the lapels'' advice of the burgeoningbookshelf of how-to guides professing admissions expertise.   ``When you're in this business, it isn't extraordinary to get ona daily basis all kinds of attention-craving devices,'' saysWilliam Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid forHarvard and Radcliffe, where some 14,000 apply for 1,600 places inthe freshman class. ``I do think some of these guidebooks havemisled students. Stunts and gimmicks can jeopardize an application,disclosing a lack of judgment or hiding positive factors.''   At Yale, where l2,000 applied for 1,200 openings, Worth Davidcomplained of seeing ``a good deal more PR tricks than we'd like.People out there writing books and acting as independent counselorsare encouraging kids to package and promote themselves.   ``Some of this makes sense. If you hide your talents, how willanyone know? But kids forget the most important part of anyapplication is the record of what courses you took in school, howyou did in them and what your teachers say about your performance.This is a heck of a lot more important than what shoes you wear toan interview or whether you remember to send a thank-you note.''   Thank-you notes are big this year.   ``All of a sudden we are flooded with them, '' David groans.``The guidebooks say sit down and write a thank-you note to yourinterviewer, and the kids, of course, want to touch all bases.''   In this media-mesmerized age nothing beats home video forcolorizing the ego and making every applicant famous for 15 minutes.	</TEXT><NOTE>By HUGH A.

The Olympia Brass Band was detained at customs upon arrival fromNew Orleans at Israel's Tel Aviv airport in September 1986. Theywere suspected of being Black Hebrews, members of a Chicago sectclaiming descent from a biblical tribe, but deemed ineligible forcitizenship by the Israeli government and subject to immediatedeportation.   Airport security confiscated Milton Batiste's trumpet case andhad it tested by the bomb squad, but missed the only realcontraband the band was carrying.   ``Wherever they go, they carry along Louisiana pork sausages,''said booking agent Harry Mayronne.   During the five hours it took to verify the band's credentials,leader Dejan handed out ``some purple and gold Mardi Grasdoubloons,'' inscribed with his picture, like the souvenir coinsthrown from the floats in the Mardi Gras parade.   ``Then everything was lovely,'' Dejan recalls. ``While we waitedto get our passports back, the immigration people let me walkoutside by the fence and pick up some holy rocks from the HolyLand.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By IKE FLORES</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Listen up, pilgrims, this is nomake-believe stuff like they put on over yonder at the Magic Kingdom.   This is down-and-dirty, bone-crunching, tobacco-spittin' rodeo,the big leagues of the cowboy game, born in the U.S.A.   As they have been doing for years, hundreds of volunteers arecleaning bullpens, putting up fences and readying the horse chutesfor the 82nd Silver Spurs Rodeo, the largest in the Southeast.   Make no mistake. The rodeo, scheduled for Feb. 23-26, is noslapped-together, amateur affair that is a side attraction to acounty fair or a carnival.   This is a fully sanctioned, professional rodeo that attracts thetop cowboy stars in the country for big-money prizes in traditionalevents such as bull riding, calf roping, steer wrestling and saddlebronc riding.   It is the celebration of an original American sport born in theOld West, where cowboys challenged each other in contests ofranching skills.   Set amid the glitzy entertainment complexes of Walt Disney World,Sea World, Boardwalk and Baseball and Cypress Gardens, this is whereyou get your Levis caked with mud, listen to the old-timers spintall tales and eat some of the best barbecued beef in the world.   To the surprise of some, Florida holds many rodeos, although it'scertainly not a part of the Old West.   ``If you wanted to, you could go to a rodeo just about everyweekend in this state,'' says Reed Berlinsky, a Kissimmeeadvertising executive knowledgeable about rodeo history.   But most are not full-fledged events sanctioned by theProfessional Rodeo Cowboy Association, the organization thatsponsors some 400 events a year throughout the country. TheKissimmee rodeo is ranked among the top 50 in that group.   Another large PRCA rodeo is held in Arcadia, which contests thelocal claim that the Silver Spurs Rodeo is the state's oldest.   One of the most unusual aspects of the Kissimmee rodeo is that itis put on strictly by volunteer labor.   Twice a year, in February and July, 300 to 400 members of theprivate Silver Spurs Riding Club and many of their relatives andfriends come together to run the show. They oversee stock, check incowboys, clean pens, work in concessions, park cars, tabulatescores, man ticket windows and put together programs, says publicistCarolyn Reis.   ``The rodeo is Americana, something real and dusty and dirty,''Reis says. ``It is remarkable because it is thriving in the middleof these sophisticated, top-name tourist attractions withmultimillion-dollar budgets and attendance.''   The event draws about 30,000 people over four days, and many ofthem are faithful rodeo fans who travel long distances to get here.   They come to see the likes of Lewis Feild of Elk Ridge, Utah,whose specialty is bronc riding. He was the reigning ``worldall-around champion cowboy'' for three years running when heappeared here last year. Feild made $144,335 on the rodeo circuit in1987, when he was ranked the top rodeo performer by the PRCA.   Last year's all-around champ at the Silver Spurs Rodeo was ClayO'Brien Cooper of Gilbert, Ariz. He and a partner have been worldchampion team ropers for three years.   Other rodeo athletes here last year included bareback rider BruceFord of Kersey, Colo, who won $102,000 on the circuit in 1987, andLane Frost of Lane, Okla., a bull rider who won $105,000.   The top rodeo stars can pick up $15,000 or more in one rodeo andusually ride in more than 100 a year, Berlinsky says.   Some of Osceola County's old-time ranch families founded theSilver Spurs Rodeo in 1944, developing it from a club that gavehorseback quadrille (dance) demonstrations for many years.   ``Club members cut their own fences, borrowed some bleachers fromsome guy in Tampa, and they became the first contestants in apasture on Geech Partin's land,'' Berlinsky says.   Geech Partin is a legend in these parts for several reasons. Healso sold some of his land to developers who later turned out to bethe Walt Disney Co.   Members of the Partin, Bronson, Overstreet, Rohde and Chapmanfamilies are active to this day in the club and rodeo.   ``We're going into the third generation of club members whosupport and work at this rodeo,'' Berlinsky says. ``We are into thesecond generation of `big bosses.'''   The big boss, or club president and rodeo director, this year isTom Booth, the assistant principal of Osceola High School who isalso a part-time rancher.   Incidentally, during the football season, the Silver Spurs arenabecomes the high school football stadium, where Big Boss Booth usedto be a coach.   The profits from the rodeo _ after all the big purses andexpenses are accounted for _ go to charity.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>IOUIK, Mauritania (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A trip to Mauritania's desolate Bancd'Arguin National Park begins with a moonlit ride down the beachwhere the Sahara Desert presses tightly against the Atlantic Ocean.   It takes a determined tourist to visit this park. It's only 125miles north of Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott, but then Nouakchottitself is only 500 yards from the edge of the vast Sahara.   The Banc d'Arguin is 4,635 square miles of sand and seacontaining one of the world's finest bird sanctuaries. The Bay ofArguin, with its underwater prairie of sea plants, is teeming withmarine life ranging from breeding food fish to seals and turtles.Inland is only trackless desert.   There are no roads to the park. There are no roads in the park.No hotels. No restaurants. No fresh water. The Tourism Ministry inNouakchott doesn't have much information about the park or how toget there.   And getting there, as they say, is half the fun.   The easiest solution is to locate one of the several Nouakchottoutfits that rent four-wheel-drive vehicles, with drivers. Fill itup with gas and they will take you anywhere. But be sure to pack allthe fuel, food and water you'll need for the duration of the journey.   Setting out at 8 p.m., Ahmed, the driver, followed a barelydiscernible track for about 20 or 30 miles into the desert north ofNouakchott, finally breaking out on the beach. He flies along thewater's edge on the hard sand, disturbing only an occasional bird.There are no troublesome turns to worry about. There is littledanger of getting lost. Just keep the Atlantic on the left and thedunes on the right.   Occasionally a jackal appears in the headlight beams, searchingthe seashore for a dinner of fiddler crabs.   The jackal is the only wild mammal still roaming the region inlarge numbers. A few dorcas gazelles remain. The dama gazelle andoryx disappeared in the 1960s, about the same time the last ostrichwas seen. The cheetah left 30 years ago. Most of these animals werevictims of long and severe droughts.   Scattered along the beach between Nouakchott and the entrance tothe park at Nouamghar are a few tiny villages of Imraguen fishermenwho have plied these seas for centuries. As the tide comes in, Ahmedrecommends a halt. He stops at the village of Tiouilit, a dozen orso slapdash homes made of bits of wood and corrugated iron.   Several villagers welcome three visitors to Tiouilit, and overendless glasses of sweet tea they gab till long after midnightbefore allowing their guests to sleep on the straw-matted floor.   Talk is simple, close to home, unpretentious. One learns that inTiouilit women are not allowed to go into the ocean. If they do,there will be no more fish, and the village will suffer.   Up early, we head again for the beach. The pink rays of therising sun wash over the dunes of the vast Sahara as they sweep downto the Atlantic.   In the flyblown huddle of cement buildings that make upNouamghar, the park lieutenant is located. For tourists, the entryfee is $38 _ expensive, but for a good cause. After a courtesy callon the local prefect, we're back on the road.   The going really gets tough here. Heading inland across thedesert, Ahmed follows the merest hint of a track. Sometimes it'ssmooth and straight, sometimes sand-swept. Finally, it disappears,as eventually does the horizon, behind a cloud of blowing sand.   The last 15 miles into Iouik is by dead reckoning.   Village chief Ahmed Baba greets his visitors warmly. There is tea_ the long Mauritanian ritual of continuous pouring and repouring _a bit of dried fish ripped into strips, a few peanuts, anddiscussion about the price of a boat to the bird islands.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Brian Dennehy is at a point in his actingcareer where he no longer needs to do television, yet unlike manyfilm stars he refuses to turn his back on the small screen.   His latest TV appearance comes Sunday in ``Day One,'' aprestigious drama on CBS about development of the atomic bomb. He'scompleting the feature film ``Street Legal,'' then he's off toMoscow and Tokyo for stage appearances as Lopakhin in ``The CherryOrchard.''   ``Most of television today is just a diversion,'' Dennehy says.``I'm at a point where I'm not expected to do TV. My response isthat if decent, like-minded artists don't do TV we can't complain.We have a social responsibility.''   Dennehy says `Day One' is a balanced look at the decision tobuild and drop the atomic bomb.   ``It's an attempt to understand the enormous accomplishment inbuilding that weapon in 2{ years without computers,'' he says. ``Andit looks at the politics of deciding to use it. The Cold War maybecome a historical artifact so it's important that we understandhow it started.''   Dennehy stars as Gen. Leslie R. Groves, the man who built thePentagon and was the ramrod behind the super-secret ManhattanProject. David W. Rintels produced the three-hour drama and wrotethe screenplay based on Peter Wyden's book.   The movie also stars David Strathairn as Dr. J. RobertOppenheimer and Michael Tucker as Leo Szilard, with appearances byHume Cronyn as James F. Byrnes, Hal Holbrook as Gen. George C.Marshall, Richard Dysart as President Harry S Truman, David OgdenSteirs as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barnard Hughes asHarry L. Stimson.   Dennehy on this day is at a hilltop park in Culver City preparingfor a night's work on ``Street Legal.'' He'll soon be up to hisknickers in muck as a maverick police lieutenant who stumbles uponan international political conspiracy. It's his first solo starringrole in a feature film.   ``I'm sweating out finishing this picture so I can get to Moscowfor rehearsals,'' he says. ``I'm probably the only guy who playscops, jumps on a plane to rush to Moscow to show the Russians how toplay Chekhov with a British director.''   Dennehy grew up in Brooklyn, where he was an all-city high schoolfootball tackle and played the title role in a senior classproduction of ``Macbeth.'' He got a degree in history at ColumbiaUniversity, then spent five years in the Marine Corps, includingeight months in Vietnam. Afterward, he worked at a variety of jobswhile honing his skills in off-off-Broadway plays.   He made his film debut in ``Semi-Tough'' in 1977, followed withroles in ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' ``Foul Play,'' ``F.I.S.T.,''``Butch and Sundance: The Early Years'' and ``10.'' Among his laterroles: ``Gorky Park,'' ``Best Seller,'' ``Silverado,'' ``LegalEagles,'' ``Cocoon'' and ``F-X.''   Dennehy, who has three daughters from an earlier marriage,recently married Jennifer Arnott, an Australian costumer designer hemet while doing ``Return To Snowy River.'' One daughter, Elizabeth,is in the CBS soap opera ``The Guiding Light.'' She bears a strikingresemblance to Glenn Close, and since ``Fatal Attraction'' she hashad some difficulty being cast in commercials.   Another daughter, Kathleen, is also an actress and has a smallrole in ``Street Legal.'' His third daughter, Deidre, attendsmedical school in Chicago.   Dennehy starred in two TV series, ``Big Shamus, Little Shamus''and ``Star in the Family.'' He was in the miniseries ``Pearl'' andhis most recent TV appearance was as a bounty hunter on an episodeof ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' under consideration as a spinoff series.   ``I'm at the point where I can do what I want,'' he says. ``Iwant to do good things. The tragedy of television is that there's solittle that is good. But the networks are in trouble and they'returning back to creative people.''   Back on the subject of his character in ``Day One,'' Dennehysays, ``Groves is a fascinating guy. He believed in his country, hebelieved in accomplishments, he believed in the work ethic. Hewasn't a very sophisticated man. He was the one man with theextraordinary mind, intellect, discipline, leadership and ambitionto accomplish the task of building the bomb.   ``People now tend to look at Oppenheimer as a Hamlet, who wasnever certain about the bomb. Once the deed was done and the bombwas dropped, Oppenheimer was a man who could not help but examinewhat he did and feel a terrible guilt. Groves, on the other hand,never doubted that it was necessary to save American lives.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bruce Boxleitner has another series in theworks, but in the lull between jobs he's back in the saddle with nocameras turning.   ``I'm taking advantage of it to ride and hunt and play therodeos,'' says Boxleitner, whose last series was ``Scarecrow andMrs. King'' and whose next is a wild comedy adventure called ``TheRoad Raiders.''   In the meantime, Boxleitner stars with Lindsay Wagner and DiahannCarroll in the two-part NBC miniseries ``From the Dead of Night,''which will be televised Monday and Tuesday.   During his time off he's going quail hunting in Georgia and willenter the cutting horse and team roping contests at the Ben JohnsonPro-Celebrity Rodeo in Phoenix, Ariz.   At the presidential inauguration in Washington, Boxleitner washost of ``A Salute To the First Lady'' at the Kennedy Center and wasa guest for dinner at the home of Vice President Dan Quayle.   ``I was up on stage in front of the National Symphony and I hadto introduce the conductor, Mstislav Rostropovich,'' he says. ``Ihad to keep saying his name over and over again so I'd get itright.''   Boxleitner, a Republican in an industry noted for its liberalactivism, says he found Washington to be an exciting place.   ``You don't have all the phoniness and tinsel you have here,'' hesays, ``and even when you do it's more important. In Washington, thepoliticians are the stars. The Hollywood celebrities might get atiny mention in the newspaper, which is the way it should be.''   ``From the Dead of Night'' is the first horror film forBoxleitner, who's more at home in the saddle. In his first series,``How the West Was Won,'' which starred James Arness, he played afugitive forced to become a gunslinger.   He co-starred with Kenny Rogers in three ``Gambler'' movies asBilly Montana, a role he has described as ``an airhead out West.''He later teamed up again with Arness for a remake of ``Red River.''   He also starred briefly in the series ``Bring 'Em Back Alive,''based loosely on animal trapper and adventurer Frank Buck, and mostrecently he spent four years co-starring with Kate Jackson in``Scarecrow and Mrs. King.''   In ``From the Dead of Night,'' he says, Lindsay Wagner ``carriesthe piece. I'm just there to help out. I'm her ex-boyfriend, andthere's a triangle relationship between Lindsay, Robin Thomas andmyself. My character's always out the door when you need him. He'san anthropologist off to a dig.   ``But when strange things start happening to Lindsay, I'm theonly one who realizes something really is going on. People allaround her are dying and then coming back as living dead. Theproducers don't want us to say zombies. It really isn't a zombiemovie. It's a classic thriller.''   Boxleitner recently completed the movie-pilot for a new seriesfor CBS called ``The Road Raiders.'' It's a World War IIcomedy-adventure he calls a ``combination of `One Flew Over theCuckoo's Nest,' `M-A-S-H,' `The A-Team' and `The Road Warriors.'''   ``I feel like I'm more a part of this because I helped put ittogether,'' he says. ``I play a wonderful character called CharlieRhodes. He's Scarecrow and Frank Buck rolled into one. When we firstmeet him he's running a saloon in Manila just before the Japaneseinvasion.   ``He's totally unpatriotic. He's out for himself. He's likeHumphrey Bogart in `Casablanca.' He's tough, rough-talking andalways has a cigar stuck in his mouth. People will say I'm doing DonJohnson. I say I'm doing Clark Gable. Clark Gable in `Boom Town.'''   Clyde Kusatsu, who was his right-hand man in ``Bring 'Em BackAlive,'' will be a regular in ``The Road Raiders'' as the villainand Rhodes' chief rival. ``Clyde and I are really the same guy,''Boxleitner says. ``We're both con men trying to outdo the other.''   Boxleitner says he thinks the timing for the series is rightbecause the third Indiana Jones movie, ``The Last Crusade,'' is dueon Memorial Day.   ``There's nothing like it on TV today,'' he says. ``I'm so tiredof all these sitcoms. There isn't any comedy adventure on the air. Ithink this will fill that need.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cindy Pickett, who portrays the mother of aCalifornia boy who was abducted at age 7, says the boy's realmother never abandoned hope during the seven years her son was heldby his abductor.   A new NBC miniseries tells the story of Steven Stayner, who waskidnapped from his home in Merced, Calif., in 1972 and held captiveuntil he was able to escape in 1979. During those seven years helived an apparently normal life as the son of his abductor, KennethParnell, a convicted child molester.   But Steven's parents never gave up hope of finding him alive.   ``She said she knew Steven wasn't dead because a mother wouldknow,'' says Pickett, who portrays Kay Stayner, the mother, in ``IKnow My First Name is Steven.''   The two-part miniseries, which will be televised on Monday andTuesday, also stars John Ashton as the father, Del Stayner, ArlissHoward as Parnell, Corin ``Corky'' Nemec as the teen-age Steven andLuke Edwards as the 7-year-old Steven.   Larry Ellikan directed. J.P. Miller and Cynthia Whitcomb adaptedthe screenplay from a story by J.P. Miller.   Parnell told Steven that his parents didn't want him any more.   ``The boy thought he haof off-Broadway's mostinnovative theaters, particularly as a home for plays that deservea second chance.   From its beginnings in an Upper West Side hotel, where audienceshad to cross a drug-infested Columbus Avenue to get to the theater,to its current space in a gentrified area of shops, restaurants andco-ops on Upper Broadway, Second Stage has made its mark.   During that decade, its commitment to re-evaluating plays likeLanford Wilson's ``Serenading Louie,'' Jules Feiffer's ``LittleMurders'' and ``The Woods'' by David Mamet hasn't waivered. Yet thetheater's vision has altered slightly.   ``We've evolved,'' explains Miss Goodman, a one-time actress whogave up acting for fund raising and administration. ``When we cameon the scene, we fulfilled a need that wasn't present off-Broadway.Everyone was doing new plays. No one was doing contemporary plays asecond time.''   Things have changed. Today, from Lincoln Center to the New YorkShakespeare Festival to the Humana Festival for New American Playsin Louisville, Ky., theater companies offer playwrights secondproductions.   ``We also did plays that maybe hadn't been done in New Yorkbefore, like `How I Got That Story' or `My Sister in This House,''' Miss Rothman says. ``They had been done in other theaters aroundthe country but not here, so they seemed like new plays.''   The women were diligent in their search for properties, readingscripts, doing library research, reading reviews and meeting withevery artistic director in New York to ask them, ``If you could doa play again that you did in the past, what would it be?''   The women spent a year raising money _ $90,000 _ and planning athree-play season before the theater finally opened in 1979.   ``We did that so we could just concentrate on the plays,'' MissGoodman recalls. ``We thought we were pretty smart. Ten days beforewe were supposed to start the first play, nearly everybody quit _the director, the lighting designer, the set designer _ and the twolead actors walked out along with them.''   Miss Rothman took over the direction of the play. Miss Goodmantook over all its technical aspects, and both begged two actorfriends to come in and save them. They did. The play didn't getgreat reviews, but it and the theater survived even if audienceshad to take an elevator to the shabby building's top floor to seethe shows.   ``If you lived to get to the 16th floor, you were happy to seeanything,'' Miss Goodman says.   Among the works presented that first season was a revival ofMichael Weller's ``Split.'' Weller has been a mainstay of SecondStage. He was the focus of the Second Stage's last season when itpresented two old Weller plays, ``Moonchildren'' and ``LooseEnds,'' as well as the world premiere of ``Spoils of War,'' a newWeller work starring Kate Nelligan that later went to Broadway.   It wasn't until the theater's third season that it attempted anew play. The premiere was ``Pastorale'' by Deborah Eisenberg.   ``The reason we did it was because it had been rejected byeverybody in and outside New York,'' Miss Goodman says. ``We readthe play and fell in love with it. She wasn't going to get aproduction unless we did it.''   The following season, a subscriber and playwright named TinaHowe came to them with ``Painting Churches,'' a play already turneddown by the New York Shakespeare Festival.   The duo decided to do it. The play was a success and transferredto the Lamb's Theater near Times Square for an extended run.   ``As we began to see we were making our mark, proving our pointand had good relationships with playwrights, it seemed silly forthem, if we had a good working experience, to take their new playsomewhere else,'' Miss Goodman says.   The relationship with Miss Howe has continued through the years.   In 1986, the theater presented the playwright's next work,``Coastal Disturbances,'' which also went on to Broadway andreceived another best play Tony nomination.   The relationship has continued with ``Approaching Zanzibar,''Miss Howe's latest work, currently enjoying a run at Second Stage.The play, which stars Jane Alexander and Harris Yulin, looks at afamily as it travels across the country to visit a dying aunt.   Miss Rothman has directed the play, something she tries to do atleast once each season. Her partner used to act in one play a year,but after the first four years, gave it up.   ``It was painful to be acting in my own theater,'' Miss Goodmansays. ``That's a lot of responsibility. Every once in a while, Isay `Hey, I could do this part.' But then I say to Carole,`Wouldn't Judith Ivey or Diane Wiest be good in this role?'''   Second Stage moved into its modern, 120-seat theater, christenedthe Walter McGinn@John Cazale Theater, in 1984. It was named foractor Walter McGinn, Miss Goodman's husband, who was killed in anautomobile accident in 1977, and a good friend of his, John Cazale,another actor, who died of cancer the following year.   Today, the theater has an annual budget of more than $2 millionfor its four-play season, and shows no sign of being a victim ofits increasing success.   ``Our mutual strength is that we have the same taste in plays,''says Miss Rothman. ``We usually agree on things.   ``Robin is incredibly giving to a production,'' she adds. ``Evenif a play doesn't get great reviews, she'll still be in there,talking to people. Just making sure that the experience of workinghere is a positive one. We're not here to make a lot of money, soyou should get some joy out of the experience.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cindy Williams and Bill Hudson, stars of theDisney Channel's ``Just Like Family,'' are indeed just like family.   Not only are the two married in real life, and the parents oftwo children, but one daughter has made an appearance on the newcomedy series.   Williams and Hudson play a childless couple that hires twochildren to pose as their offspring. That's to satisfy the whims ofHudson's new boss, who runs a children's clothing company and dropshints about Hudson being a ``family man.''   The weekly half-hour comedy series, taped before an audience,made its debut in mid-May.   One of the children in ``Just Like Family'' is named Emily,after their 6-year-old daughter.   ``The real Emily was in a birthday party scene recently,'' saysWilliams, who is best known for her role as Shirley Feeney on thehit comedy series ``Laverne and Shirley.'' ``She was a tad confusedwhen we called the actress Emily.''   ``She'd told us one day, `Why can't I be on the show?''' Hudsonsays. ``The next week was the birthday party and we talked to theproducers. She was an extra with no lines. Afterward, when we tookher home, she said, `Next time I want lines.'''   Both parents say they like the family feeling of working at theDisney Studio.   ``It's like being in high school,'' says Hudson, who began hiscareer as a member of the musical group The Hudson Brothers. ``Thestudio's like a campus. It's a real family atmosphere.''   Williams quit ``Laverne and Shirley'' in 1982 when she becamepregnant. The series, which also starred Penny Marshall as LaverneDe Fazio, lasted for another season. The show, a spinoff of ``HappyDays,'' made its debut in January 1976 in first place in theratings. It finished the season in third place and the next seasonit was second to ``Happy Days.'' It was first for two seasons,1977-78 and 1978-79.   Since then, Williams has been looking for another series andworking mostly at Disney.   Williams had starred in ``Save the Dog'' for the Disney Channeland did two Disney Sunday Movies, ``The Leftovers,'' with JohnDenver, and ``Help Wanted: Kids,'' with Hudson. The latter inspiredthe current series.   ``They didn't have any actors for the movie on a Friday and itwas due to start filming on Monday,'' she says. ``JeffreyKatzenberg (president of Walt Disney Studios) called and asked ifBill and I would do it. The movie did very well in the ratings.''   Williams turned down initial overtures from the studio to makeit into a series.   ``I didn't want to do a show about parents and kids,'' she says.``I felt the market was saturated. I wanted to do an ensemble show.That didn't happen, so I said let's do this one.''   In the series, they play a young couple that moves from New Yorkto Nevada when the husband (Hudson as Tom Burke) accepts a new jobwith a children's clothing company. Williams is Lisa Burke, abig-city newspaper woman who finds her only outlet is a smallweekly newspaper. Gabriel Damon, 13, and Grace Johnston, 8, alsostar as their ``rented'' children.   Pat McCormick appears as the head of Giddyup Clothes and DanHedaya is the seedy Uncle Lucky.   ``The way we explore the rented aspect is that both the adultsand the children need something from each other,'' Hudson says.``We need them for the job and they need us because they're littlescam artists. They live with Uncle Lucky, who's always got somescheme going.   ``The important thing is that a bond grows between the coupleand the children. Especially with Cindy, whose maternal instinctscome out.''   But, Williams adds, ``Basically, it's a comedy.''   ``Cindy's theory is that we have 22 minutes, so make themlaugh,'' Hudson says.

It led to his first television series, NBC's ``Quantum Leap,'' acomic adventure about time travel in which he appears only as ahologram.   ``Marriedso brought Stockwell his firstnomination for an Academy Award as best supporting actor.   ``It's something I've dreamed about for years,''  To the Mob'' alhesays. ``Thereality is...I can't describe it. It's just one of the best feelingsI've ever had.''   Just before he committed himself to ``Quantum Leap,'' Stockwellsays, he was working with Orion Pictures on a series pilot based onhis character of Tony the Tiger in ``Married To the Mob.''   ``But they took too long to put it together,'' he says. ``ThenDon Bellisario called and offered me this. It's the first timeanyone's offered me a series and the first time I've ever wanted todo one. If people hadn't seen me in ``Married To the Mob' theywouldn't have realized I could do comedy.''   Stockwell and Scott Bakula star in ``Quantum Leap'' as physicistswho are working on a time travel experiment. Bakula isrch.   In ``Married To the Mob,'' Stockwell was Tony ``The Tiger''Russo, a character who's right up there with Scarface, Little Caesarand the rest, but is still charming and personable and in aperverted way is like a yuppie hood.   Stockwell says he is into his ``third career.''   His father was Harry Stockwell, a Broadway performer who replacedAlfred Drake in ``Oklahoma.'' He was the voice of Prince Charming inWalt Disney's ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''   As a child, Dean Stockwell appeared on Broadway in ``InnocentVoyage.''   The studio scouts saw him and he was in such movies as ``AnchorsAweigh,'' ``The Boy with Green Hair,'' ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' and``Kim.''   ``I was very lucky to have a loving and caring and sympatheticmother and not a stage mother,'' he says. ``She was very helpful tome as a child. It wasn't always easy.   ``I dropped out of acting a few times. I quit when I was 16 anddidn't come back until I was 21. When I came back I did`Compulsion,' `Long Day's Journey Into the Night,' `Sons and Lovers'and `Rapture.'''   Stockwell dropped out again in the 1960s to become a hippie.   ``I never really wanted to be an actor,'' he says. ``I foundacting very difficult from the beginning. I worked long hours, sixdays a week. It wasn't fun. I came back each time because I had noother training.''   The second time he returned, Stockwell found it very difficult toget re-established. It wasn't until he did ``Paris, Texas'' that hefelt he had made it. ``Out of sight, out of mind,'' he says. ``Luckhas a lot to do with it.''   Since then, he's done ``To Live and Die in L.A.,'' ``Dune,''``Beverly Hills Cop II,'' ``Gardens of Stone,'' ``Blue Velvet'' andthe TV movie ``Gambler III.''   In ``Tucker,'' he played Howard Hughes. He co-stars with DennisHopper and Jodie Foster in ``Backtrack'' and with Kim Cattrell in``Palais Royale.''   Stockwell makes his permanent home in New Mexico with his wife,Joy, and their two children, Austin and Sophia.   Stockwell hopes his brother, Guy, can appear with him in anepisode of ``Quantum Leap.'' Their last time acting together was in``Innocent Voyage'' on Broadway 40 years ago. Guy had been in anumber of movies and was in such series as ``Adventures inParadise'' and ``The Richard Boone Show.'' In recent years he hasdevoted most of his time to teaching.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Deputy District Attorney Grace Van Owenfrequently stumbles over her own seriousness. ``Grace is very muchin her element in the courtroom,'' says actress Susan Dey, who playsher on NBC's ``L.A. Law.''   ``But I battle with her in terms of how serious she is.''   At the moment, Dey is prosecuting another of Van Owen's hopelesscases, outfoxed by a sly attorney and facing a jury swayed bysympathetic defendants. On the courtroom set on a sound stage at20th Century Fox Studios, three old-timers are on trial for robbinga bank.   Lew Ayres, 81, white-thatched and slightly stooped, has the juryhanging on every word. ``They robbed the bank because they couldn'tdraw out their senior citizens money,'' he says.   ``They're very sweet men,'' concedes prosecutor Van Owen, adding,``who committed a very serious crime.'' She doesn't smile. Her suit,a black-and-gray striped jacket with padded shoulders and a blackskirt, reinforces her no-nonsense attitude.   Although some of the comic scenes in ``L.A. Law'' are played ather expense, Van Owen is by no means a loser. As the love interestof attorney Michael Kuzak (Harry Hamlin), she's bright and talented,beautiful and sexy.   Back at the makeup trailer parked outside the stage, Dey pondersthe paradox that is Grace. ``She's in a very serious environment.She feels safest when she's at work. She's most insecure when she'saway from that environment,'' Dey says.   ``I like her best in a dilemma, when the crisis comes. In adramatic or comedic conflict. She has a vulnerability in a conflict.She's really a powerful woman. She's strong. When something gets toher, it's wonderful. She gets frustrated. She can be outwittedbecause she's so serious. Her determination boxes her in.''   Makeup artists Lee Mitchell and Candy Conery work on her face forthe next scene. Then Sarah, her 10-year-old, enters the trailer.``Boo-Boo's here!'' Dey exclaims, jumping off the high makeup chairto hug her.   Sarah is from a previous marriage. Dey is now married totelevision producer Bernard Sofronski.   Van Owen isn't known for doing things on impulse, but on a showearly this year she did suddenly kiss Victor Sifuentes (Jimmy Smits).   ``Nothing's come of that yet,'' says Dey. ``For us, the momentwas so wonderful for Grace to fulfill this fantasy. But there's notalk that anything will come of it. Steven Bochco said it was justsomething Grace has always wanted to do.   ``That was one of the few times I got to work with other membersof the cast besides Harry. I'm usually in court. It was a newexperience and it was fun, too. I'm kind of lucky. There's a lot ofgive and take. I work the long hours in the courtroom, which makesyou kind of crazy. But I get to work with all these wonderful gueststars.''   She was not in the ``L.A. Law'' pilot, but was cast after runninginto executive producer Bochco at a school function for theirchildren. Bochco was looking for a love interest for Kuzak, as wellas another view of the law.   Dey says she spent about a month in court with a deputy publicdefender researching an earlier role for another pilot. She usedthat as background for the character of Van Owen.   The daughter of a newspaper editor from upstate New York, Dey haddone commercials and modeling before making her debut as Laurie in``The Partridge Family'' in 1970. The show, starring Shirley Jonesand David Cassidy, was about a singing family.   ``It was pure luck that I got `The Partridge Family,''' says Dey.``I thought I was an adult. I was 16 when I did the pilot and 17when we started the show. I was 21 when we finished.''   Her next series was ``Loves Me, Loves Me Not,'' a romantic comedyco-starring Kenneth Gilman that lasted only a few weeks in 1977. Shewas also in the short-lived CBS prime-time soap opera ``EmeraldPoint N.A.S.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Diane Lane was apprehensive about thereception awaiting her in Texas when she arrived for her role as a``sporting gal'' in the CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove.''   One of her co-stars in the epic Western story is Tommy Lee Jones,who was her husband and a tough gambler in her last movie, ``The BigTown.''   During the filming of that movie, she says, Jones ``was so deepinto his character that I was a little intimidated. When I finishedmy part I left without saying goodbye. I was a little worried how hewould greet me when I got to the `Lonesome Dove' set. Well, he swungme around and said, `How are you, darling?' I'd never seen him sojovial. People looked and I said, `He's my ex-husband, you know.'''   In the miniseries, Lane stars as Lorena Wood, the town prostituteat the Dry Bean Saloon in Lonesome Dove, Texas. Most of her scenesare with Robert Duvall.   The four-part miniseries, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winningnovel by Larry McMurtry, kicks off the February sweeps for CBS onSunday and is continued on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.   Jones and Duvall both play former Texas Rangers who run a smallranch called the Hat Creek Outfit. They are almost opposite in theirpersonalities. Jones is Woodrow F. Call, who is sullen and taciturn,while Duvall is Augustus McCrae, who is charming and philosophical.   The story centers on an arduous cattle drive to Montana, whichbecomes a metaphor for life itself, with all of its adventures andtriumphs and failures and its diverse and clashing personalities.   Lorena persuades another former Ranger to take her along afterthe trail drive. She is kidnapped by a renegade Indian, raped andsold to a band of traders. She's rescued by Gus.   Bill Wittliff wrote the screenplay, based on McMurtry's novel,and Simon Wincer directed. It also stars Danny Glover, Robert Urich,Frederic Forrest, D.B. Sweeney, Ricky Schroder and Anjelica Huston.   ``I was one of the last people cast,'' Lane says. ``I loved therole and I loved her relationship with Duvall.''   Lorena, she says, is ``a very introverted character and that canbe difficult to play on a TV schedule. I thought it would be a greatchallenge.   ``Lorena loves Gus but she's not in love with him. Sex has beensuch a bitter experience for her. She loves him like a fatherfigure. But it's more than that. He loves her completely. He knowsher better than she knows herself. She's powerless to resist hislove. She could win a fight with a dragon, but there's no point infighting Gus.''   Lane says she cannot imagine any other actor playing Gus. Duvallhas a way with dialogue she felt might sound licentious coming fromanother actor.   ``The first scene we filmed is the first one you see in theminiseries,'' she says. ``It's a poker game that will decide whetherI'll get into the poke with him. He cheats, of course.   ``Lorena is the true cliche whore with a heart of gold. She's nota conniving person. She wishes she was because everyone else is. Onereason I wanted to play her is that I've played so many connivingwomen. That's more of a cliche than the whore with the heart ofgold.''   Much of the miniseries was filmed near Del Rio, a border city inTexas, where the cast frequently crossed over the border forauthentic Mexican food. Crossing back was sometimes more difficultafter a few margaritas, she says.   When she's not acting, Lane lives near Augusta, Ga., with herhusband, actor Christopher Lambert. They met when they did a tangotogether on a TV show when she was promoting ``The Cotton Club'' andhe was promoting ``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of theApes.''   Lane grew up in New York. Her father, Burt Lane, was a theaterworkshop director, who gave her an early introduction to the stage.Her mother was a singer and model. She made her film debut at theage of 13 with Laurence Olivier in ``A Little Romance.''   She also starred in ``The Outsiders,'' ``Rumblefish,'' ``TheCotton Club,'' ``Cattle Annie and Little Britches,'' ``To Elvis WithLove,'' and ``Streets of Fire.''   ``I started as a baby in an experimental, avant-garde play,'' shesays. ``It was like a tribal opera. It was a trilogy of Greektragedies. Once I got into acting my father was beyond instrumentalin keeping me in the business. I was doing plays and homework andtouring. It was too much for one person. He was there to carry methrough.   ``I must say he didn't get a lot of appreciation until later.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dinah Manoff's earlier work for the producersof ``Empty Nest'' almost prevented her from getting a role in thenew NBC comedy.   The show, about a recently widowed pediatrician who suddenlyfinds himself living alone, was created by Susan Harris, who alsocreated ``Soap'' and ``The Golden Girls.''   Manoff plays Carol Weston, the self-absorbed daughter of thepediatrician, played by Richard Mulligan, and sister of apolicewoman, played by Kristy McNichol.   ``They auditioned hundreds of actresses,'' she says. ``EverybodyI knew went in for that role. They couldn't find what they werelooking for.''   It would seem that Manoff would have had an edge because she hadplayed Elaine Lefkowitz in ``Soap'' for the producers,Witt-Thomas-Harris.   But, she says, ``They didn't think I was right for the part atfirst because of the work I'd done in `Soap.' The characters weredifferent. They didn't want the New York, Jewish, fast-talking,tough Mafia princess I played in `Soap.' I'd played the same kindof character in the movie `I Ought To Be in Pictures.'   ``So I asked to read. When I read I made sure that none of thatwas showing. And they saw it and cast me.''   Manoff says she has ``a real affinity'' for the writing of SusanHarris.   ``I understand her rhythm,'' she says. ``I understand herlanguage.''   Manoff also claims an affinity with her character in ``EmptyNest.''   ``Carol, in my mind, is always on her way to therapy or comingfrom therapy,'' she says. ``She's usually in a self-absorbed stateof mind. For me, the character is rooted in PMS, pre-menstrualsyndrome.   ``My favorite line is when Kristy comes bounding down the stairsand says, `My greatest fear has happened. I'm falling in love.'Carol says, `My greatest fear is that there is no such thing as PMSand this is who I really am.' Every woman in the audience howledfor 10 minutes. That's who Carol is and who I am on my worst days.''   She disagrees with descriptions of Carol as neurotic. ``She'sjust terribly self-involved,'' she says. ``Everything has torevolve around her. If there's a disaster somewhere, her onlythought is how does it affect her. She regularly takes heremotional temperature.''   Manoff grew up in a show business family. Her mother isactress-director Lee Grant and her stepfather is producer JoeFeury. Last summer she worked in ``Boy's Life,'' a movie made onlocation in South Carolina directed by her mother and produced byher stepfather.   ``It was very interesting,'' she says. ``It was kind of likebeing 14 and told to clean up your room. That's the downside. Theupside is that she and I are very close friends and very admiringof each other as actresses and artists.   ``I know my work is safe with her because she will only let medo good work. But when she's directing we have to go back to achild-parent relationship. It pushes all my buttons when she tellsme how to fix my hair and how to dress. I try not to call her Momon the set, but when I'm tired and cranky it slips out.''   She'd worked for her mother once before, on a TV movie called``A Matter of Sex.'' The movie, which also starred Jean Stapleton,was about sexual discrimination in the workplace.   She didn't begin acting until she was 19 because her motherdidn't want her to be a child actor. She was a college film studentbriefly, then quit to pursue her acting career.   ``I'd like to direct someday,'' she says, ``but I'll leavefilmmaking for later in life. Acting is creative and a release fromyour emotions. That's fun. Directing is more comfortable and putsyou in charge. As an actor you have to be open and vulnerable. Asdirector you get to be an adult doing a grown-up job.''   Manoff studied at the Actor's Studio and made her professionaldebut in a production for PBS called ``The Great Cherub KnitwearStrike.'' Next, she did a small role on the TV series ``WelcomeBack, Kotter.''   Manoff won a Tony in 1980 for her Broadway role in ``I Ought ToBe In Pictures.'' She reprised her role in the movie version.   Her only other series was ``Soap,'' on which she played thedaughter of a gangster and the wife of Danny Dallas (Ted Wass). ``Iwas spoiled and mean, a real pain,'' she says. ``Then I turnednice. It was `The Taming of the Shrew,' or the Jew. I became sweetand loving and there was no place for my character to go, so theykilled me off.''   Her film ``Child's Play'' is just out and ``Bloodhounds ofBroadway'' is due in September. Another movie, a thriller called``Backfire,'' is coming up on Showtime.   She is starting a new movie called ``Welcome Home, RoxieCarmichael,'' which also stars Winona Ryder and Jeff Daniels.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dinah Manoff's earlier work for the producersof ``Empty Nest'' almost prevented her from getting a role in thenew NBC comedy.

Knotts honed his familiar characterization from his earliest daysin television, when he was the tense little man on ``The Steve AllenShow.'' He twitches and fidgets and speaks in a voice that rises innervous inflections.   Then in the 1960s on ``The Andy Griffith Show'' he won five Emmysas Deputy Barney Fife, the bumbling lawman with childish pretensionsand a nervous tic. The character got another incarnation as RalphFurley, the bombastic landlord on ``Three's Company.''   Now, Knotts, who first teamed with Griffith in ``No Time forSergeants'' on Broadway and in the film, is back with Griffith inNBC's ``Matlock.'' He plays Les Calhoun, a retiree andself-described ``king of plastics,'' who moves in next door to BenMatlock, the crime-solving Southern lawyer played by Griffith.Calhoun is a man frequently in trouble because of his inability toleave well enough alone.   Knotts, in person, displays none of the hilarious and sometimesexasperating mannerisms. His voice is soft and his manner is almostcourtly.   ``It sure is fun to work with Andy again,'' he says. ``In thefirst show we had a chance to sit down and do some of the things weused to do in `The Andy Griffith Show.' Just talk. That was real fun.   ``I try to keep him different from Barney, but some of it'llcreep in. Working with Andy it's hard to stay away from it. And Idon't know that I should stay totally away.''   Knotts and Griffith had last worked together three years ago inthe NBC movie ``Return to Mayberry,'' a reunion of the gang from``The Andy Griffith Show.''   ``I got a call from Andy in North Carolina last summer during thewriters strike,'' Knotts says. ``He said he'd been talking to theproducers about working me into the show. I thought he was kidding.But he wanted to add something to the show. He kept calling.   ``I was in Traverse City, Mich., doing a play. He called me againafter the strike was over and said we need to talk business. And Irealized then that he really meant business. I wasn't sure.''   When Knotts got home from doing the play the first script hadalready been written.   ``It went through a lot of rewriting,'' he says. ``People don'trealize it but Andy does a lot of rewriting. The stuff we had talkedabout he made sure got in there.''   Knotts quit ``The Andy Griffith Show'' at the end of five years,but returned regularly for guest appearances.   ``Andy said he was going to leave after five years, so I said Iwould, too,'' he recalls. ``Universal offered me a picture deal. Ileft, but Andy changed his mind and stayed. I spent five years atUniversal doing one picture a year. Then I did my variety show onNBC but it didn't do very well. It did go the full season, and afterthat I free-lanced. I sort of wound up with a picture contract atDisney. They guaranteed me a picture a year.''   Then came five years on ABC's ``Three's Company.'' He also didhalf a season as the school principal on the syndicated comedy``What a Country!''   Knotts grew up in Morgantown, W. Va., where he was called``Spider'' because of his wiry build and excelled in basketball andwrestling. He was attending the University of West Virginia when hewas drafted during World War II.   He was in the Army show ``Stars and Stripes'' and toured theSouth Pacific with a comedy act. After the war he returned to gethis degree and do postgraduate work at the University of Arizona.   But he was soon in New York doing radio.   ``I played the old-timer on a Western series,'' he says. ``Iborrowed Gabby Hayes's voice and the guys used to kid me about it.One day Gabby visited the studio and the guys set me up. I wasrehearsing and he burst through the door and gave me hell for usinghis voice. I was scared to death. Then everybody started laughing.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eric Idle, like a knight-errant in comicarmor, has cut a swath from Monty Python's Flying Circus in hisnative England to his new series for NBC, ``Nearly Departed.''   He's also found time recently for a role as Berthold, thefastest man alive, in ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' and asPasseportout, Phileas Fogg's woman-chasing, wine-bibbing Frenchvalet, in the NBC miniseries ``Around the World in 80 Days.''   In ``Nearly Departed,'' which makes its debut Monday, April 10,he and Caroline McWilliams play spirits, only recently departed,who try to dislodge the new occupants from their home.   ``It's not polite comedy,'' he says. ``I seriously want thosepeople out of the house.''   Idle was concerned with the lack of time available as he filmedsix episodes of ``Nearly Departed.''   ``It takes twice as much time to do comedy,'' he says. ``Theydon't give you enough lead time. The writer was reworking thecurrent script while he was writing the next week's script. Ididn't do any writing, but I'm allowed to rewrite and punch up. SoI put my bits in.''   Idle plays an English lecturer at the University of Chicago whois killed with his wife by falling rock while on vacation. Insteadof heaven or hell, they go back to Chicago to haunt their old home.   ``Nearly Departed'' is an original series but the concept hasoccasionally popped up in such past projects as ``Blythe Spirit''and ``Topper.''   ``You get a chance to comment on people right in front of themand they can't hear you,'' Idle says. ``We haunt Stuart Pankin andWendy Schaal and their child, Jay Lambert. Only the grandfather,Henderson Forsythe, can hear us.   ``It's necessary to have someone you can communicate with or itdoesn't relate. You can't make the comedy work without that.''   Idle was in the forefront of British television's ``golden ageof comedy,'' both as a writer and an actor. He did three serieswith Monty Python's ensemble of nonsense comedians and edited thespinoff books and co-wrote and appeared in three Monty Pythonmovies.   Idle's role in ``Around the World in 80 Days'' took him toLondon, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Yugoslavia and the River Kwai inThailand.   Some railroad scenes were filmed on the River Kwai Railroad, theinfamous line built by Allied prisoners of war in the movie ``TheBridge Over the River Kwai.''   ``Every foot of the railroad represents someone who died,'' Idlesays. ``It's beautiful and chilling at the same time.''   Idle notes that since ``Around the World in 80 Days'' waswritten by Jules Verne, a Frenchman, Passeportout receives a moresympathetic treatment than does the Englishman Fogg.   ``Verne pictured Fogg as the punctual Englishman who must havehis bath water at a certain temperature,'' Idle says, ``whilePasseportout chases women and drinks wine.''   ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,'' the new epic fantasyfrom Columbia Pictures, was directed by Terry Gilliam, anotheralumni of Monty Python. John Neville plays the title role. RobinWilliams plays the king of the moon.   ``Munchausen was an 18th-century character who used to boastabout his exploits,'' Idle says. ``The tales eventually becameshort stories that were favorites with children.   ``I play an actor who plays Berthold in the play within a play.I had my head shaved for six months in order to play Berthold. Hehas spent 20 years in prison on the moon.''   Idle describes the movie as an epic fantasy in the mold of ``TheWizard of Oz'' or a Cecil B. DeMille film.   He says it's unlikely that the Monty Python team will get backtogether, except perhaps for a special on the 20th anniversary.Members of the ensemble were Gilliam, Idle, John Cleese, TerryJones, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Greg Evigan, who portrays a carefree artiston NBC's ``My Two Dads,'' is an artist of a different sort in reallife. He's a singer and songwriter.   Evigan co-wrote the theme song for the sitcom and sings it onthe air. He also wrote the music for a recent movie and has adevelopment agreement with RCA Records.   As Joey Harris on ``My Two Dads,'' he designs practical artobjects, such as some of the furniture in the apartment he shareswith his old college chum, Michael Taylor (Paul Reiser), and their``mutual'' daughter, Nicole (Staci Keanan).   Unlike Joey, a bachelor who's fatherhood is unconfirmed, Eviganis married and has three children. The child in the sandbox playingJoey as a 3-year-old in the pilot for the series is his son, Jason.   In his first series, ``A Year at the Top,'' Evigan played anaspiring rock singer who's tempted to make a pact with the devil togain success. Before that, he was in the road company production of``Jesus Christ, Superstar,'' and starred as Danny Zuko in``Grease'' on Broadway and in Chicago.   ``My Two Dads'' has been on-again, off-again for the past twoseasons. It made its debut in September 1987 and ran for the wholeseason. Then it was off the air for the first half of this season.It returned in January, was pulled to make room for spring tryoutseries and is now back on the air.   In the show, Evigan and Reiser play former college buddies andromantic rivals who now lead radically different lifestyles. Eviganplays an artist and Reiser is an uptight, upwardly mobile financialadviser. They are drawn together by the arrival of Nicole after thedeath of her mother. In her will, the mother says one or the otheris the father and she wants them to raise her daughter together.   The show also stars Florence Stanley and Dick Butkus.   ``I wasn't looking to do a situation comedy,'' Evigan says. ``Ithought I was going to do a dramatic show, but my agent said justgo in for the meeting. They told me Paul was doing it and I said,great, I love his work. They said I could sing the theme song, butthey wouldn't guarantee I could write it.   ``We did the pilot, which was called `Who's Dad?' I'd heard itwas a write-off and wasn't supposed to go on the air. They said thenetwork had plenty of shows. But apparently one of the other showsdidn't work out and we were on the air.''   Evigan describes his character as a free spirit.   ``He'd rather go by his instincts, whether it's right orwrong,'' he says. ``He gets into a lot of trouble that way, andsometimes he's right. That's the catalyst for the relationship withPaul Reiser. The struggle is to see how we change. Maybe I learnfrom him and maybe he learns from me. But each of us retains ourbasic values.   ``We see how Nicole reacts to it. That validates whether myinstincts are right or wrong. We're all learning from each other.Each episode has a moral, which can be a little syrupy, but if youplay it from the heart it can be good.''   Evigan's first series, ``A Year at the Top,'' went through along and convoluted development, between 1974 and 1977. When itfinally reached the air it lasted only five weeks.   Paul Shaffer, who's now on NBC's ``Late Night With DavidLetterman,'' was Evigan's musical partner in the fantasy comedy.One version, called ``Hereafter,'' was televised by NBC in 1975.The show later went to CBS.   Between times with that show he also did 10 episodes of asyndicated show called ``All That Glitters.'' That was a show inwhich roles were reversed. Women ran the company and men were thesecretaries.   ``I played a schoolteacher on trial for taking students out onthe front lawn to watch dogs mate,'' he says. ``I said it waseducational. I was defended by a woman lawyer. It was a big thingthen, but it's pretty tame now.''   Evigan spent three years in the NBC series ``B.J. and theBear.'' It borrowed the trucker and pursuing sheriff of ``Smokeyand the Bandit'' _ and Evigan's sidekick chimpanzee, Bear, was aclone of Clint Eastwood's companion in ``Every Which Way ButLoose.'' Later, Claude Akins, as the TV series sheriff, was spunoff into a series called ``Lobo.''   Evigan's next series was ABC's ``Masquerade'' in 1983-84, whichasked us to believe that the CIA was so short of qualified agentsthat it recruited ordinary people with special skills forundercover work. He co-starred with Rod Taylor and Kirstie Alley.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gregory Peck rushes into his living room, lateand apologetic, wearing a white warm-up suit. He'd had to take his60-year-old azalea bonsai to a Japanese tree surgeon.   ``I'm not a great gardener,'' confesses the 72-year-old actor whowill be honored Tuesday on ``The American Film Institute Salute toGregory Peck'' on NBC. ``I just try to follow instructions and keepthings from dying.''   Peck, who has reached the twilight of his acting career, findsplenty of time for gardening.   ``I'd like to keep working,'' he says, ``but if I don't workagain that's OK with me.''   In the NBC special, such former co-stars as Lauren Bacall(``Designing Woman''), Audrey Hepburn (``Roman Holiday''), CharltonHeston (``Big Country''), Jennifer Jones (``Duel in the Sun'') andJimmy Smits and Jane Fonda (``Old Gringo'') will pay tribute to thestar whose film career goes back to 1943.   His latest film is ``Old Gringo,'' in which he playsauthor-journalist Ambrose Bierce in a fictional account of hisdisappearance during the Mexican Revolution in 1913. The movie, inwhich Jane Fonda plays a spinster American schoolteacher and Smitsis a fiery Mexican general, will be released later this year.   ``Things are slowing down, but I expected that,'' Peck says.``I'm getting on in age. There was a time I was champing at the bitif I didn't make three pictures a year. For all I know I may nevermake another picture.   ``But somebody may be at a typewriter writing a new picture andthinking of Greg Peck for one of the roles. Most of the goodpictures I've done have been dropped into my lap.''   Peck says his own favorites from among the 51 pictures he's madeare ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' the film that brought him an AcademyAward as best actor in 1962, ``Roman Holiday,'' ``The Gunfighter,''``Captain Horatio Hornblower'' and ``The Guns of Navarone.''   ``Hornblower'' was based on the books about the British navalhero created by C.S. Forester. Peck says he'd always hoped to do asequel.   Peck describes ``The Guns of Navarone'' as ``good, all-outentertainment,'' but says it's really a comedy.   ``It's a put-on,'' he says. ``Five or six guys take on the wholeNazi army and beat them. Every time we turned one way, the Naziswent the other way. It was the Keystone Kops. It was a put-on of agreat war picture.''   He refers to ``Duel in the Sun'' as a parody of a Western thatthey called ``Lust in the Dust'' when they were making it.   ``Jennifer Jones had just played a saint in `Song of Bernadette'and I had played a saintly priest in `Keys of the Kingdom,''' hesays. ``David O. Selznick took great delight in casting us as Lewtand Pearl. I was the renegade son and she was the wild half-breed.''   In recent years, Peck has also appeared on television. He playedAbraham Lincoln in the 1982 miniseries ``The Blue and the Gray'' andwas a priest in ``The Scarlet and the Black'' in 1983.   ``I've been offered series,'' he says. ``I'm not snobbish abouttelevision. You want to make it as good as possible, but ontelevision you never have enough time. I'd rather wait for somethinggood to come along. Or not work at all.   ``When you reach 70 it limits people's perceptions. They begin tothink of you as too old for roles. But that's OK. I don't blamethem. And I do want to play parts my own age.''   Unlike some actors, Peck admits that he occasionally watches hisold films on television.   ``I saw `Shootout' recently for the first time since we made itin 1971,'' he says. ``It was directed by Henry Hathaway, who alsodirected me in `How the West Was Won.'   ``He was a director from the old school who tried to tell a storyvisually. `Shootout' was somewhat similar to `True Grit,' whichHathaway had also directed. He always had something going, anenergy, a drive, and a way of linking the scenes together.   ``Seeing my films years later I've come to appreciate thedirector much more. At the time you're wrapped up in your role andyou're trying to do it as well as you can. You can't see the forestfor the trees. But after time has gone by I can appreciate thedirector's style.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If you're 30 something you've probably neverheard of Richard Grieco, but if you're under 30 you know he's thehottest ``hunk'' in the fall television season's coolest new show.   Grieco set young hearts throbbing last year in Fox's ``21 JumpStreet'' as the handsome, brooding, rebel cop Dennis Booker.   In September, Grieco will be spun off into ``Booker,'' whichSaatchi &amp; Saatchi, the New York advertising agency, forecasts asthe only hit of the television season. That the show is on theso-called fourth network speaks to Grieco's appeal and to thechanging face of television.   ``Booker's rebellious in the sense that he doesn't do things bythe book,'' Grieco says. ``He's unorthodox, but he's honest. Theybrought me onto `21 Jump Street' to be an antagonist, then getkilled off after six shows. I guess the audience liked my characterand they decided to keep me on.   ``We'll get more into his private life on the new show. We knowhe has a mother, but they didn't get along. He's a loner. He didn'teven have a girlfriend. They brought someone on but it didn't lastlong.''   In the final episode of ``21 Jump Street'' in the past season,Booker arrested Tom Hanson, played by Johnny Depp, on a charge ofmurder. The story picks up in the first episode of ``21 JumpStreet'' in September.   ``I get Johnny out on a 48-hour pass and we retrace the steps ofwhat happened,'' Grieco says. ``What happens is I uncover a lot ofcorruption in the city government. I offend a lot of people in highplaces and have to leave the police force and become a privatedetective.''   ``Booker'' takes over the Sunday night time slot of ``21 JumpStreet'' _ which jumps to Monday to open a new night of programmingfor Fox.   Grieco's longish black hair is combed up and back and fallsloosely over his face. He is dark, with dark eyes and a wide mouththat curls up into a half-smile. He's Italian on his father's sideand Irish on his mother's. He's wearing jeans, a black T-shirt withsunglasses stuck into the neck and a leather wrist bracelet withbig, silvery studs.   He's bigger than he appears on screen. He's 6 feet tall,muscular, but down to 165 pounds compared to the 220 he weighedwhen he played college football. He collects vintage motorcycles.   In the new show, Booker goes to work for a large company calledthe Yamada Corp.   Booker will occasionally ride a motorcycle as a symbol offreedom.   ``He's a fish out of water,'' explains Grieco. ``He's surroundedby all these corporate types. They're not used to people like me.My uniform is basically what I'm wearing now, a T-shirt and jeans.They're into suits and ties. He tries to get along with the peoplebut he doesn't conform. I'm basically the house detective, but I'llalso take cases from the outside. So, it's the hip side of `21 JumpStreet' with the background of `L.A. Law.'''   Grieco grew up in Watertown, N.Y., just south of the Canadianborder, where he played hockey, lacrosse and football. His fatheralso collects motorcycles, including a 1941 Indian Scout and a 1939three-wheeler. Grieco has a 1954 Harley-Davidson that he keeps inWatertown.   He went to Central Connecticut State on a football scholarshipand majored in political science. At first, he thought he was goingto become a lawyer but started acting in college.   Grieco left school after three semesters and four kneeoperations due to football injuries.   In New York he was a model but soon began to study acting. Hejoined the soap opera ``One Life To Live'' as Rick Gardener, acharacter he jokingly referred to as ``a rebel ski bum.'' While hewas on the show he got more mail than anyone else.   ``I remember my first day on the set,'' he says. ``I'd been onstage but never in front of a camera before. I was so nervous Icouldn't speak. The producer kept calling the sound booth andsaying, `He's not breathing.'''   Two years ago he moved to Los Angeles and landed roles on ``Ragsto Riches,'' ``Who's the Boss'' and ``The Bronx Zoo.''   He auditioned for ``21 Jump Street'' with about 100 otheractors. He was called back five times before he got the role. Thenhe had little time before he had to fly to Vancouver, BritishColumbia.   ``Booker'' also will be filmed in Vancouver, where StevenWilliams, Peter DeLuise and other stars of ``Jump Street'' willoccasionally pay a visit to the new show.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jeffrey Jones calls his first televisionseries, ``The People Next Door,'' a ``light, romantic comedy with asubversive twist.''   In the CBS show, Jones plays a successful cartoonist named WalterKellogg who has a new wife, two kids and a powerful imagination. Thelatter figures heavily in the stories because everything he imaginessprings to life.   ``I became a cartoonist because things in my imagination suggestcartoons to me,'' Jones says. ``But it's not cartooncie Allen.   So welcome Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney in their latest enterpriseas stars of off-Broadway's eminently successful ``The Kathy and MoShow: Parallel Lives.''   They play teen-agers, retired women, angels in heaven, lonelyfolks in a bar, sometimes even men.   But they're not just after laughs.   Mo says, ``We get letters from people who say the show made themthink. And it just makes some people happy. I'm not saying everyscene we do has a message.''   Kathy says, ``Even our two alcoholics in the country bar, we seethe fun in them and the reality of them and think they're not toodifferent from us. That's a fun piece to do.''   But there is meaning and respect here, too, as the humorousmini-plays roll off their stereotypical subjects, for instance acouple of unsophisticated older women going back to college.   ``Discrimination, for sexes and races, as a whole has bothered meforever and will continue to until it's gone,'' Mo says. ``This ispretty much what we have to say.''   Kathy adds, ``If we're feeling particularly concerned withwomen's self-esteem or how women and men think they're supposed tobe and how we go about fulfilling that, that's going to pour out inour work. Society is obsessed with telling women how they'resupposed to be, under the auspices of being more liberated. It isjust another set of rules. I think we waste a lot of time when wecould just be living.''   When they're creating, Mo says, ``Scenes begin with a characteror an issue or a situation. It's easiest to build around characters,I think. You know what they'd do and say and what situation they'dbe in.''   A San Diego native whose parents are from Beirut, Kathy Najimystudied acting and directing at San Diego State. ``I had no thoughtof being in a duo,'' she says. ``I was in feminist theater, Sisterson Stage, in college. I was a director in San Diego, was in tons ofmusicals. I have an alto, belting voice. I got tired of that realquick. I did a couple of serious plays.   ``I directed teen-agers in a stage show that got brought to TVand won two Emmys. I did a one-woman show, `It's My Party,' did abit of stand-up at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles. For five years,I was always in something.''   Then Kathy and Mo met in 1982 and wrote some skits for ``TheKathy and Mo Show.'' After a planned evening performance forfriends, the show played the Old Town Theater in San Diego, thenDon't Tell Mama here. In 1986, ``The Further Adventures of Kathy andMo'' opened at the Second Stage Theater here, then toured. Kathy andMo added some skits and opened the present version at the WestsideArts Theater on Jan. 31.   ``Now we've got TV, film and book offers we're thinking about,''Kathy says. ``We might move to Oregon and open a Laundromat.''   And, sadly, they might go separate directions for awhile. Kathywants to direct and perform in other things. Mo has been writing ascreenplay and would like to write for and act in films.   Mo Gaffney, named Maureen by her mother who thought Maureencouldn't be nicknamed, at 18 received stationary from a friendemblazoned ``Messages from Mo-face.'' Mo stuck.   ``I was in a feminist improv group, Hot Flashes, for a longtime,'' she says. ``We played women's festivals. I'm like a grown-upfeminist now. I always wanted to be an actor. Writing came almostfrom having to, so you don't always have to audition for somebodyelse's play.   ``I was a funny little kid. It was easy to be in my family. Wedidn't sit around the piano and sing but we had great lines shootingback and forth.''   Kathy, who met her boyfriend, painter and pianist John Boswellhere, says, ``We're very different. Most of the time the differenceis wonderful. Sometimes it's a problem. I loved New York right away.Mo didn't adjust to it too well and does not want to live here.''   Mo says, ``I keep the books. Kathy talks to people, goes tobusiness meetings. I type the scripts and do the correspondence. Ilike working on my word processor. She's more outgoing. I likekeeping things in order.   ``The only thing we're the same on is writing. That's where wemerge best. One of us comes up with an initial idea. There'll be acertain amount of discussion and rewriting. This show is almostexactly 50-50 as far as writing is concerned.''   Kathy says that the hardest scene to play is one in which threesisters meet. ``I play two of them. They're normal women, our age,our economic bracket. It's not like one has a Southern accent. Theycan't be that different. It's really difficult to find subtledifferences of people much like myself.   ``It is easier to find truth in the dramatic parts. Comedy istruth plus timing plus facial expressions.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kim Delaney had to read some history to getready for her new roll in the series ``Tour of Duty,'' which is setin a war she is too young to remember.   Delaney joined the CBS series as it returned to the air thismonth for its second season, this time with more emphasis on womenin the war. She plays Alex Devlin, a combat correspondent for a wireservice called American News International.   ``I had no real awareness of the war,'' Delaney says. ``Theshow's set in 1968 and I was only 7 years old. I didn't have muchtime to study before I got the job. But I've spent a lot of timesince then reading and looking at documentaries, trying to get afeeling of the passion people felt then. It's particularly hard tofind something written by a woman.''   In its first season last year, ``Tour of Duty'' focused on anArmy platoon assigned to combat duty in the late 1960s. This season,the time frame moves ahead slightly to 1968 and the platoon isreassigned to Tan Son Nhut Air Force Base in Saigon.   Besides Delaney, Betsy Brantley and Dan Gauthier have also joinedthe cast. Brantley plays a civilian psychologist working for thegovernment and Gauthier is a young helicopter pilot. The show'sreturning stars are Terence Knox, Stephen Caffrey, Tony Becker, StanFoster, Ramon Franco and Miguel A. Nunez Jr.   The changes in ``Tour of Duty,'' heretofore an all-male show thatrevolved around combat situations, undoubtedly reflect the successof ABC's ``China Beach.'' That show, set at a hospital and rest andrecreation area, puts its emphasis on the women in Vietnam.   Delaney says she is sometimes confused with Dana Delany, whostars as a nurse in ``China Beach.''   ``My character has an office in Saigon but she spends a lot oftime in the field,'' she says. ``It's a good role because I'm notwith just one person. I'm involved with all the people. Alex isinnocent when she arrives. She hasn't been corrupted by the world.She wants to get to the truth of each story, whatever it is, at anycost.''   Alex Devlin also develops a love interest with Lt. Myron Goldman,the platoon leader played by Stephen Caffrey. She's also attractedto Lt. Johnny McKay, the helicopter pilot played by Gauthier. Herrole as a correspondent requires her to take frequent trips tocombat zones in a helicopter.   Delaney made her professional debut in the ABC soap opera ``AllMy Children'' in New York. She had a recurring role in NBC's ``L.A.Law'' and earlier this year was in the NBC miniseries ``Something IsOut There.''   In the miniseries, she played the girlfriend of Joe Cortese, whois her boyfriend in real life.   ``I grew up in Philadelphia and went to all-girls Catholicschools,'' she says. ``I didn't act in high school because I wasvery shy. I had four brothers and I probably spent more time attheir school than mine. Actually, I didn't know what I wanted to do.   ``My father came home from work one day and said how about courtreporter? He wanted me to go to college, but he knew I was rebellingagainst more schooling. I studied court reporting some. I can'timagine doing that today.''   After high school she moved to New York and began a modelingcareer. ``I got an agent and he gave me the name of some actingcoaches,'' she says. ``I studied for two years. That's when I knew Icouldn't imagine doing anything else. My second year of studying Igot `All My Children.'   ``I wasn't sure I should take it. I made sure I was out of thestudio in time for my classes. The other actors thought I was crazy.I was just starting out. I didn't know what blocking meant. I didn'tknow how to make my mark. Some of the show's crew stayed after hoursto show me how to move.''   Her character on the soap opera, Jenny Gardener, ``took off likea shot,'' she says. ``She was a very sweet ingenue, a victim, a girlfrom the wrong side of the tracks trying to make good.''   Delaney stayed with the show three years.   Her first movie was ``That Was Then, This Is Now,'' which tookher to Minnesota. Since then, she's been in ``The Drifter,'' ``DeltaForce,'' ``Campus Man'' and ``Hunter's Blood.'' Her TV films include``Take My Daughters, Please,'' ``Christmas Comes To Willow Creek,''``Cracked Up,'' ``First Affair'' and ``Perry Mason: The Case of theSinister Spirit.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NBC's ``Hunter,'' a detective drama starringFred Dryer, is a show that is reversing a television trend.   The usual course for a hit series is to reach a ratings plateau,then slowly decline as the show becomes complacent and finally runsout of steam.   ``Hunter,'' which begins its sixth season in September, turnedthat routine on its ear. ``Forget the first two years,'' Dryer says.``They don't count. We're going into our fourth season.''   The show has been climbing in the ratings, finishing in a tie for16th place this past season. The stories have also gotten better andhave more substance. ``Hunter'' has bounced about the schedule, butseems to do best on Saturday at 10 p.m.   In the beginning, the ratings were lackluster. So were thestories. The show was a blatant rip-off of Clint Eastwood's ``DirtyHarry'' film character.   Dryer, the 6-foot-6 former All-Pro defensive end for the LosAngeles Rams, even closely resembles Eastwood. Hunter began as aswaggering, unorthodox cop who carried a .357-caliber Magnum,relentlessly pursued the bad guys and constantly fought with hissuperiors.   Stepfanie Kramer also stars as his partner, Sgt. Dee Dee McCall,an equally hard-boiled detective who was nicknamed ``the brasscupcake.''   ``We've evolved way out from that,'' says Dryer. ``He'sunorthodox today if it's unorthodox to be compassionate, to liveyour job and take it home with you. I credit Roy Huggins withturning the show around during his time as executive producer. Hetook a show that was making very small concentric circles and openedit up and set up guidelines to make it bigger and better with moreemphasis on stories.   ``What I contributed was to take those stories and tell themthrough the characterizations of Hunter and McCall. The audiencemust see how we react, how we feel about things. The relationshipbetween Hunter and McCall is drastically important. You must careabout the people you are watching.''   More changes are due in the fall. Dryer and his partner, LawrenceKubik, will become executive producers.   ``You're going to see a lot of subtle changes in communications,in quality control and in post-production,'' Dryer says. ``Hunterand McCall are moving away from the station house to Parker Center.It'll give it a more contemporary, high-tech look. We're redesigningthe set and we're making it easier to film in. The old setphysically restricted where you could place the cameras.   ``We'll do fewer car chases, fewer fistfights. Our stories willhave more to do with decision-making by Hunter and McCall. They'llhave more to do with the human condition, where one truth cancollide with another truth. Our scripts will be more accommodatingto good roles for guest stars.''   As a football player, Dryer believed in preparation. He adheresto that same practice as an actor and producer.   ``The people paying you never see the preparation,'' he says.``But that's the most important thing you do. I sit in on all thestory pitches and conferences. I have good writers and I rely ontheir tastes and ideas, but I help them structure the stories.   ``This is a collaborative medium and I enjoy that. I want to hirepeople and let them do their job. But they can only do that ifeveryone is clear on the vision we're trying to accomplish. It'sgoing to be my vision and my taste.''   Dryer has his own production company and is developing films, buthe doesn't expect to have time for them until ``Hunter'' leaves theair. He thinks the show will go at least another two years.   Since starting ``Hunter'' in 1984, Dryer has made four guestappearances on ``Cheers'' and went to Israel in 1986 to star in thefeature film ``Death Before Dishonor.''   Dryer says first on his schedule after ``Hunter'' is to build anew house with his own hands. ``I have a lot of builders in myfamily,'' he says. ``My brother and I helped my father build hishouse. If I wasn't in acting and producing I'd be in construction.   ``The great thing is I can do other things in life. My life isn'tdefined by the fact that I do `Hunter' or that I was a footballplayer. I want as many diversified experiences as I can have. If I'mprepared for it it won't get by me.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Peter Ustinov's round-the-world travelschedule would give the Jules Verne characters of Phileas Fogg andDetective Fixx a serious case of jet lag.   Ustinov, winner of two Oscars and three Emmys, was in LosAngeles recently to talk about his role as Fixx, the intrepidEnglish detective who trails Fogg in the NBC miniseries ``Aroundthe World in 80 Days.'' The comic adventure, featuring PierceBrosnan as Fogg and dozens of other stars in cameo roles, will betelevised Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.   The day before his arrival here, Ustinov had been in theNetherlands Antilles, resting, working on a novel called``Reunion'' while it rained, and soaking up sunshine on the fewdays when it wasn't.   (``I write in longhand,'' says Ustinov, who has published fournovels and two books about Russia. ``All I need is a monk toilluminate the first letter of each chapter. I'm very oldfashioned.'')   Before the Antilles, Ustinov had been in Hamburg, West Germany,for a celebration of Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's 70thbirthday.   Ustinov lives in Switzerland and Paris with his French-bornwife, Helene.   This was Ustinov's second offer to play the role of DetectiveFixx. The first came in 1956 when Mike Todd made his version of theJules Verne novel about an English gentleman who bets his entirefortune that he can circle the Earth in 80 days. Fixx chases afterFogg in the mistaken belief that he has robbed the Bank of England.   ``Mike Todd asked me to do it,'' Ustinov recalls, ``but I had acontract with 20th Century Fox, which had money invested inCinemaScope and didn't want Todd to succeed with his Todd-AOwide-screen process. They wanted me to play Van Johnson's sidekickin `23 Paces to Baker Street.' I got out of that, but stillcouldn't do `Around the World.' Now, 30 years later, I have thesatisfaction.''   His present role came about when he was offered a cameo in theminiseries.   ``However much they tempt you with money,'' he says, ``it's veryunsatisfying to go off having tasted food and not being able toswallow. Then they suggested another cameo. I said I just didn'tlike cameos.   ``Then they said how about Fixx? I said that was possible. WithFixx I had my revenge on all the sergeants in the army. He's verymuch like sergeants _ plebian, shrewd, stupid, everything mixed.''   Ustinov, a private in the British Army in World War II, said hemade Detective Fixx into a touching figure.   ``He's an idealist,'' Ustinov says. ``He's in love with a veryunlovely woman. In times of stress, he consults her picture. In theend, he marries her.''   Ustinov's work on ``Around the World in 80 Days'' added to hisreputation as a world traveler. He filmed in Macao, Bangkok, HongKong, San Francisco, Liverpool and Yugoslavia.   ``We filmed on a plain east of Belgrade for China,'' he says.``I wondered where they were going to get all the Chinese neededfor the scenes. Even if we raided all the Chinese restaurants, Ididn't think we'd find enough people. But, they showed up. I saidwhere did they all come from? I was told they were in Yugoslavia tostudy Serbian.''   The three-part series also stars Eric Idle as Passepartout andJulia Nickson as Princess Aouda.   After he completed work on the miniseries, Ustinov immediatelywent to work on an Italian movie called ``The Paradise of Dogs.''   ``I played a veterinarian who drinks,'' he says. ``It's a comedyand they said it's like Disney. I said it's not like Disney, it'sItalian. It's a rather charming observation of people and animals.He drinks to get rid of his inhibitions so he can communicatebetter with the animals. That itself is very Italian.''   Ustinov will also appear in a French miniseries commemoratingthe bicentennial of the French Revolution. He plays Mirabeau in theshow, which also stars Jane Seymour and Klaus Maria Brandau.   On Feb. 1, Ustinov was inducted into the French Academy of FineArts, filling the vacancy created by the death of Orson Welles. Hissword was made by his son, a sculptor, and youngest daughter, ajeweler.   Ustinov, who won his Oscars for ``Spartacus'' and ``Topkapi,''is also well-known for playing another detective, Hercule Poirot.He played the Agatha Christie creation in three feature films andthree television movies.   ``Poirot did nothing but ask questions and ask them in aninteresting way,'' Ustinov says. ``It can be exhausting. Only inthe last 10 minutes do you have the luxury of expanding andexplaining why everything happened as it did.   ``Agatha Christie was jealous of her creation. Despite all herother work, publishers kept asking for more Poirot stories. Shetreated it as an attempt to take over her authority. She finallywrote a story killing him off and put it away. When she became illher daughter authorized its publication.   ``She had the pleasure of killing off Poirot a few days beforeshe went herself.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert Hays says the idea behind his new NBCsummer series ``FM,'' which will be televised for the first timethis week, was to do a comedy about a young man and his problemswith women.   The show is set against the background of a listener-supportedradio station in Washington, D.C.   Hays, who starred in ``Airplane'' and the ABC series``Starman,'' plays the program director and on-air personality atthe small station. The frenetic pace of the job forces him topostpone many decisions affecting his personal life.   ``He has a problem making a commitment,'' says Hays, ``and whena woman gets too close he gets scared. Yet, he's surrounded bywomen. His ex-wife, his teen-age daughter, his attractive newassistant, his boss and others, as well as a fan named Misty whokeeps asking him to play `Laura.'   ``He hires his ex-wife to come back and liven up an opinionshow. Ever since she'd left, the conservative had carried on aloneand it was so dull. His ex-wife gets jealous when he hires a prettynew assistant.''   Besides the women in his life, co-creators and executiveproducers Allan Burns and Dan Wilcox mine the eccentric andopinionated volunteers who work at the station.   ``FM'' is scheduled to debut this Thursday behind ``Cheers'' andin place of ``Dear John.'' The following week it moves to itsregular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. for four additionalepisodes. It had been a pilot for the fall season.   The show also stars Patricia Richardson as his former wife,DeLane Matthews as his assistant, Nicole Huntington as his daughterand Lynne Thigpen as his station boss.   The series began when Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBCEntertainment, suggested that Burns write a show about a man andhis problems with women.   ``There have been shows about women and their problems withmen,'' says Hays. ``Then Brandon said he wanted Robert Hays. Atthat time I was looking at things and had something I really wantedto do but the script was not quite right. I read the script for`FM' and it was good and funny.   ``I thought, `Oh, boy, why does this have to happen?' You decideon something and another show comes along. But `FM' was in shapeand I said I'd do it. We did the pilot and when it wasn't picked wethought that was the end of it.''   Hays describes his character, Ted Costas, as a likable guy whohas major responsibilities at the station but gets a small salary.``He does it because he loves it,'' he says. ``He loves the freedomhe has.''   Hays starred with Donna Pescow in ``Angie'' on ABC in 1979-80,then went on to such movies as ``Airplane,'' ``Take This Job andShove It!,'' ``Airplane II,'' ``Trenchcoat,'' ``Scandalous'' and``Cat's Eye.'' He was in such TV ventures as ``California GoldRush,'' ``The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything'' and a livedramatic production of ``Mr. Roberts.''   His last series was ABC's ``Starman'' in 1986-87, based on thehit movie. He played an alien who returned to Earth to find his sonand was forced to stay one jump ahead of government scientists.   He also appeared in a production of ``Teahouse of the AugustMoon'' at the Burt Reynolds Theater in Florida.   Hays, currently in production for the new series, is just backfrom doing a movie in Spain. He co-starred with Kim Cattrell in``For Better or Worse,'' which he calls a ``romantic comedy,adventure and murder mystery.''   ``Kim and I meet in a library and it's kind of love at firstsight,'' he says. ``She's a travel agent. I can't wait to call her.Next thing you know we're married and I don't yet know her travelagency is a front for the CIA.   ``On our honeymoon in Spain someone slips a couple of millionbucks into her suitcase. We keep getting into trouble and I have noidea why.''   Following ``Starman,'' Hays says he was not in a hurry to getback into television.   ``I just didn't have a strong desire to do anything that wasn'tfun,'' he says. ``Fortunately, I didn't have to get back to work. Ihad the liberty of being able to wait.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Bobby Joe Stuckey takes over hisfather's television evengelism empire in HBO's ``Glory, Glory'' andis soon up to his halo in trouble, just like...well, some recentheadline-makers.   But Richard Thomas, who stars as Bobby Joe, insists that thescript for the 3{-hour musical comedy was written long before Jimand Tammy Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart became household names.   ``The script's been around for a while,'' says Thomas,best-remembered as John Boy on the TV series ``The Waltons.'' ``Wefilmed it last summer in Toronto. It more or less started as anexamination of the phenomenon of television evangelism.''   The story originated in 1981 with co-executive producer BonnyDore, who had worked briefly with evangelist Oral Roberts inpolishing his broadcasts.   ``If I felt the film was taking cheap shots at someone's faith Inever would have done it,'' Thomas says. At the center, Stuckey is aman of true faith but he's been seduced into straying. He can speakfor the importance of spirituality, but all institutions are subjectto compromise and corruption.''   The movie, directed by Lindsay Anderson (``The Whales ofAugust,'' ``O Lucky Man'') will premiere on Sunday.   Bobby Joe is a biblical scholar totally lacking in the starquality his father used to turn his little church into a televisionempire. He's earnest but dull, and the ratings start to tumble. Indesperation, he turns to a down-and-out rock singer who becomes thecharismatic Sister Ruth. The ratings and the donations reachunprecedented levels with Sister Ruth.   But behind the altar, unknown to Bobby Joe, she's leading a lifeof Sodom and Gamorrah. He's deeply in love with her, and when itcomes crashing down he's the candidate for a pillar of salt.   Ellen Greene stars as Sister Ruth, Winston Rekert as aninvestigative reporter, James Whitmore as a church elder and BarryMorse as Bobby Joe's father, the Rev. Dan Stuckey.   ``When they called me they said the part was for a nice,clean-cut preacher,'' Thomas says. ``Some things you do becausethey're radically different from what you've done before. Some youdo because they're familiar. This was familiar, but I liked the wayit was written. It's satire without taking cheap shots.   ``He compromises himself with this woman, and before he knows ithe's trapped in a web of deceit and conspiracy.''   In February, Thomas goes to the Hartford Stage in Connecticut for``Peer Gynt.'' He will appear in a new translation of Henrik Ibsen'sseven-hour play, which will be presented over two nights. Thesix-week run will keep him there until May.   ``I played `Hamlet' there in 1987,'' Thomas says. ``That'sShakespeare's longest play and this is a thousand lines longer than`Hamlet.' Many people consider the play to be Ibsen's masterpiece.''   Thomas spends much of his time teaching classes at collegesacross the country.   ``And, with any luck, I'll get another TV movie or two,'' hesays. ``That's how it works out. I don't have the most expensivehabits. A TV movie will take care of my expenses so I can do theaterand teach. Then when I'm at home it's a full-time job for my wifeand I to look after four kids.''   Thomas left ``The Waltons'' in 1977. The immensely popular seriesthat ran on CBS from 1972-81 was based on Earl Hamner'sreminiscences about his boyhood in Virginia, in 1977.   ``I'd love it if we had a reunion show,'' Thomas says, ``but onlyEarl could write it. He's a sly fox with a deliciously wicked senseof humor. He's as much a country bumpkin as Donald Trump.''   As for another series, Thomas says he would certainly considerit. ``But a series takes up so much of your time it would have to besomething I absolutely loved,'' he says. ``I prefer plays, but I'man actor. The material comes first. If it's right I'll go anywhereand work in any medium.   ``I have been lucky as an actor. I've always gotten work. I'venever had to wait by the phone. Too many actors regard the theateras some place you go to stretch, as though it was an aerobics class.Or they say it's their duty to go back, as though it were anobligation like having tea with a maiden aunt. When people see me ina film they see my work. But when they see me on stage they see mework.''   Thomas recently observed 30 years as a professional actor. Hemade his debut in 1958 at the age of 7 in ``Sunrise at Campobello.''He played the youngest of Franklin Roosevelt's children, John. Thatsame year he made his television debut in ``A Christmas Tree'' forthe Hallmark Hall of Fame.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The role that beautiful, outgoing Polly Draperlanded in ABC's ``thirtysomething'' originally called for anoverweight, mousy frump.   ``The producers liked me and flew me out from New York for sometests as Ellyn,'' she says. ``They said they loved me but theydidn't think I was right for the role.''   The tall, svelte Draper could never be called a frump. And with astrong, sometimes almost overwhelming personality, she's hardlymousy.   ``In the beginning, they saw Ellyn as sort of on the patheticside,'' she says. ``My personality is just too strong.   ``They changed the concept of the character because they realizedthere was more opportunity for growth. Then they began writing forme. They knew I loved to do comedy, so they wrote some humor in.''   ``Thirtysomething,'' the so-called ``yuppie soap opera,'' hasjust completed its second year on ABC. The drama, created byMarshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, has a strong following amongyoung adults. But overall, it's not strong in the ratings and wasn'tin the Top 30 shows for the season.   The series follows a group of young people coping with careers,marriage, children and contemporary life. The characters seem tospend as much time moping as coping and the ``whine'' list on thisshow is strictly vintage.   The series also stars Timothy Busfield, Peter Horton, MelanieMayron, Ken Olin, Patricia Wettig and Mel Harris.   Draper was interviewed during a break in the filming. Althoughmost shows are out of production at this time, the producersscheduled three shows for next season in anticipation of an actors'strike, which never came to pass.   ``Melanie Mayron and I play the single girls and the show we'redoing is about computer dating,'' she says. ``We just can't meet thekind of men we want to meet, which is flawless men. I've just brokenup with my boyfriend in the show. Ellyn also has an ulcer from herhigh-powered job as the head of some kind of program at City Halland from the strain of everything else.''   Draper was living in New York, doing mostly theater, when sheauditioned for ``Thirtysomething.''   ``I'd never auditioned for a series before because if you did aseries that meant you couldn't do movies,'' she says. ``I made aliving acting. I did some small parts in films. I was almost gettinggood parts in movies and getting disappointed. Almost getting a roleis the worst thing. It's like being runner-up in the Miss AmericaPageant.   ``I played Marilyn Monroe in a play in New York called`Insignificance,' believe it or not. It took me two hours to getinto makeup and costume. I was shocked when I saw myself in themirror.''   Draper was born in Gary, Ind., but grew up in Palo Alto, Calif.   ``I went to Yale so I really feel like I'm from the East,'' shesays.   Her father is an official with the United Nations and hergrandfather was Gen. William H. Draper Jr., one of the architects ofthe Marshall Plan.   ``The only thing I can remember about Gary is that I was bittenby a hamster when I was 3,'' she says.   ``I sort of got into acting because in the eighth grade there wasa boy I wanted to kiss. I'd never really been kissed. So I createdthis whole Camelot play so he could play Lancelot and I wasGuinevere. But it didn't work out. Our noses kept getting in theway. I didn't really know how to kiss. On the way home I kept hopingthe school bus would crash.''   Draper says that since then she's learned how to kiss and how toact.   ``I'm also single this year,'' she says. ``It's frightening. Iseparated from my husband. We're taking a vacation together,however.''   Her husband is Kevin Wade, who wrote the screenplay for ``WorkingGirl.''   She and Melanie Mayron also did a layout for Vogue magazine.   ``It took five hours just for the makeup and lighting,'' shesays. ``Both of us came away with a lot of beauty tips.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tim Reid is back with his wife, Daphne MaxwellReid, in a new CBS television show that for the first time he cansay is really his own.   He and his wife not only star in the stylish romantic mystery,``Snoops,'' but he helped create it. As co-executive producer, healso controls every aspect of the show.   One thing he wanted was a racially mixed crew.   ``Rarely in this town do people have an opportunity to work in anintegrated environment,'' Reid says. ``When I did `Frank's Place,'45 percent of the people behind the camera were black. This willprobably be more than that.   ``We have blacks at every level. We have black writers and blackdirectors and I especially made it a point to find a black womanwriter with experience. People keep telling me you can't findexperienced blacks. I found them. My job is to find qualified peoplein areas of production closed to women and minorities.''   Reid says it's necessary to find enthusiastic people to make ashow a success.   ``In the pilot I remember there was no way we could get oneshot,'' he says. ``But I saw people pull together and go the extramile. In television, you have to give 150 percent to get a show onthe air and keep it on the air. It has to have a special spark.''   In ``Snoops,'' Reid and his wife play Chance and Micki Dennis, anoffbeat professional couple in Washington that always seems tostumble upon a murder. He's a criminology professor at GeorgetownUniversity. She's chief of protocol at the State Department.   The sophisticated, crime-solving couple and their clever reparteeare in the mold of ``The Thin Man,'' ``Mr. and Mrs. North,''``McMillan and Wife'' and ``Hart to Hart.''   Reid, when he is asked about the comparison to ``The Thin Man,''says, ``I hope so.''   His wife and co-star adds, ``We talked about that concept. Weloved Nick and Nora Charles and the fact that these things happenedwithin their lives. They didn't go out looking for things. We lovedtheir repartee. It will be stylish. I think it's in tune with thetimes. Families and romance are back.''   Daphne Reid, a former fashion model who was the first black womanon the cover of Glamour magazine, will be attired in the latestfashions for her job and for the many diplomatic parties they willattend. Reid's character is described as an ``eccentricconservative'' who will wear vests.   ``Snoops'' will be the first time a black woman has starred in aone-hour drama since Teresa Graves was in ABC's ``Get ChristieLove'' in 1974-75. If the series goes past 22 episodes, it will bethe first time a drama with a predominantly black cast has beenrenewed.   Reid was on several television shows in the 1970s, including theshort-lived ``Richard Pryor Show,'' but it was his role as discjockey Venus Flytrap on ``WKRP in Cincinnati'' that made him famous.After that, he was detective Downtown Brown on ``Simon &amp; Simon,''then in ``Frank's Place.''   ``Frank's Place'' was one of the best shows of the 1987-88season, but it was moved frequently on the schedule by CBS and nevercaught on with the audience. In that show, Reid was a New Englandcollege professor who inherited his father's Creole restaurant inNew Orleans. The show was called a ``dramady,'' a mixture of dramaand comedy.   ``Hugh Wilson, who created `Frank's Place,' is doing a morecommercial show this season with `The Famous Teddy Z,''' Reid says.``I'm doing a more commercial show with `Snoops.' It'll have moremass appeal and the stories will be lighthearted. You have toentertain. I think `Frank's Place' forgot that.''   Daphne Reid says, ``We want to portray a black family because weare one. We want people to see a black family and have something forthe community to root for. What the world knows of black families iswhat they see on television. We want them to see all aspects.''   Reid will also be seen this fall in John Frankenheimer's ``TheFourth War,'' which also stars Roy Scheider, Harry Dean Stanton andJergen Prochnow. He had previously worked with directorFrankenheimer in ``Dead Bang,'' starring Don Johnson.   Reid says he will have a segment on each show featuring aWashington street kid. ``I want him to do something positive,'' hesays. ``We had some difficulty finding one for the pilot becauseevery kid we auditioned was middle class.''   Despite the resemblance to ``The Thin Man,'' Reid says there willbe no dog. ``We won't drink as much, either,'' he says. ``I willalso do anything I can to avoid a drug story. If we do anything atall it will be about rehabilitation.''   Reid created the show with writer Sam Egan.   ``We were looking for an occupation for Daphne's character,something stylish and glamorous,'' he says. ``We went on vacation tothe Bahamas and ran into two sisters, Dickie and Fuzzy. Dickieworked for the State Department and that's how we came to make herhead of protocol. Then when we filmed the pilot we picked a house inGeorgetown and it turned out to be only a few doors from Dickie'shouse.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Timothy Daly believes that if you're going tobe an actor you also have to be a people watcher.   ``I watch people, I listen to people, I make up stories aboutpeople,'' says Daly, who stars in the new CBS series ``AlmostGrown.''   ``I live in New York City and what's so wonderful is that if youhave to research a character all you have to do is walk out thedoor.''   He recalls having a role as a blind man once and found a blindman on the streets.   ``I followed him around for a while,'' he says. ``He didn't knowI was there so he wasn't self-conscious.''   ``Almost Grown'' is a drama that takes Norman Foley (Daly) andSuzie Long Foley (Eve Gordon) through three decades of courtship,marriage and divorce. They travel back and forth through theirlives, as though in a time machine triggered by the music of aparticular era. Their relationship, attitudes and roles vary withthe times.   Foley is program director for a radio station, so there isconstant music to trigger the flashbacks.   ``It's interesting that when we go back in time the charactersremember it with a different perspective,'' he says. ``He mayremember a time as happy, she may remember it as sad. The story isusually told from my point of view, but sometimes it's Eve's orsometimes it's Albert Machlin's, who plays Eve's brother.''   Daly says he was approached about the series by David Chase, oneof the executive producers. They had previously worked together onan episode of ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents.''   ``At first I was very skeptical because of the different ages Ihad to play,'' Daly says. ``All the people I've seen in miniserieswho put shoe polish in their hair. How was I going to be accepted asa 40-year-old?   ``It's a real acting job. It's more fun. You get to wear wigs andcostumes and switch periods. It's a great part.''   It's the second series for Daly. Six years ago he played a doctorin ``Ryan's Four,'' which lasted only a few weeks on ABC. He was inthe miniseries ``I'll Take Manhattan'' and in January starred in theCBS movie ``Red Earth, White Earth.'' His feature films include``Made in Heaven'' and the upcoming ``Love or Money'' and``Spellbinder.''   Daly grew up in suburban Rockland County, northwest of New YorkCity. His father was actor James Daly and his sister is Tyne Daly,formerly of ``Cagney &amp; Lacey.'' He has two other sisters who he sayswere ``spared from acting careers.''   ``Thank God I wasn't a professional kid,'' he says. ``It allowedme to have my life and little bit of innocence. One of the thingsthat's really important for an actor is to live. That's what actorsdo, reflect life. If you spend your life on a sound stage you don'tget a clear picture of what's going on in the world.''   Daly says he feels he became a professional actor when he got hisEquity card in 1978.   ``I was going to play with my dad in `Equus' on a summer stocktour,'' he says. ``He died the day we were to start rehearsals.Kevin McCarthy took over the role. I have bittersweet memories aboutit. I had worked once before with my dad in `Jenny Kissed Me' at theBucks County Playhouse. They wrote in one line for me. I'd alwaysmiss the curtain calls because I'd be out back skipping rocks on theriver.''   He has never worked with his sister, Tyne. There was some talk ofa role on ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' but the show rarely used guest stars.   ``I took acting very seriously,'' Daly says. ``In my family thestage was hallowed ground. My mother was also an actress. In thefourth-grade play the other kids would have adoring parents takingpictures. I'd get notes. `You upstaged yourself.'''   Daly's wife, actress Amy Van Nostrand, recently had a guest roleon ``Almost Grown'' and co-starred with Tyne Daly in a TV moviecalled ``Kids Like These.''   They met while playing opposite each other in Sam Shepard's``Buried Child'' in 1981 at Trinity Repertory Theater in Providence,R.I. They have a son, Sam, who will soon be 5.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tom Bosley, who stars in NBC's ``FatherDowling Mysteries,'' probably looks more comfortable in a clericalcollar than any actor since Pat O'Brien, even if his St.Christopher's medal does have a Star of David on one side.   The suggestion prompts a slight smile and an arching of histhick eyebrows. ``Pat O'Brien played my uncle on `Happy Days,''' hesays.   The smile becomes a laugh as Bosley expands on his own ethicbackground.   ``My great-grandfather was chief Orthodox rabbi of Chicago,'' hesays. ``But I lived near a Catholic church and had a friend whosang in the choir. I was a boy soprano, and even though I wasJewish I'd go over and rehearse and sometimes sing with the choir.   ``My wife is Catholic. She corrects me if I do something wrongas Father Dowling. When we did the pilot she gave me a medal withSt. Christopher on one side and the Star of David on the other.''   Bosley stars as a crime-solving Chicago priest in the NBCseries, adapted from the novels by Ralph McInerny. The one-hourseries has just completed its spring tryout. It gave NBC its bestratings in three years during its Friday night time period.   ``Father Dowling Mysteries'' is expected to return in the fall,although the final decision depends on how well other tryout seriesdo.   The show also stars Tracy Nelson as Sister Steve, a formerstreet kid who is his savvy contact with more worldly sources, andMary Wickes as Marie, the rectory housekeeper.   Bosley was contacted about the role while he was still playingSheriff Amos Tupper on CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote.''   Producers Fred Silverman and Dean Hargrove originally consideredthe older ``Father Brown'' book series, but those stories turnedout to be too sophisticated to adapt for television.   ``They contacted me five years ago, during the first year of`Murder, She Wrote,''' Bosley says. ``Fred had this idea for me andgave me a volume of `Father Brown' to read on location in Mendocinoand during a later vacation in Europe. I must say the idea forTracy Nelson was my idea. I felt we needed someone to give the showa youthful balance.   ``At the same time, she's his guide to the street world just ashe's hers for the world inside the church. Someday we hope to do aback story of how she came into the sisterhood.''   Bosley got his first chance to test the waters as a priest in a``Perry Mason'' movie in May 1986. Michele Greene starred as a nunwho was accused of murdering a young priest she reputedly wasromantically involved with. Bosley played Father DeLeon.   ``They wrote the part for me after the original script wasfinished,'' he says. ``I was the priest who was always readingSherlock Holmes. Michele Greene was considered for the part ofSister Steve, but she'd already done a pilot called `L.A. Law.'''   Bosley says he adapted a few things about Father Dowling to suithimself.   ``He was probably a man who wanted to be a policeman and flunkedthe physical,'' he says. ``He always had a penchant for solvingcrimes. He incurs the wrath of the bishop quite often. He's naiveto the ways of the world. He doesn't drive. He never has any moneyin his pocket. Someone else always has to pay for the cab.   ``The bishop is always after him because his church is behind ondonations. He has to ask people for money and gets it in ways thatare unusual. He'll talk to someone about a crime and they'll wantto give him a donation. They haven't got time for him.''   The two-hour pilot was filmed in Chicago, but the seriesepisodes were made in Denver. Silverman and Hargrove also film``Perry Mason'' there. As a result, Bosley and Debbie Reynolds,guest star in a recent ``Perry Mason'' movie, had a reunion.   ``We kept passing each other in the lobby of the hotel where wewere staying,'' he says. Bosley played her brother in ``The DebbieReynolds Show'' in 1969-70.   ``That show came on eight weeks before the end of cigaretteadvertising. Her public relations man sent a telegram saying shewouldn't work because the show had a cigarette sponsor. That killedthe show.   ``The thing I remember most is that my dear mother, who was thenin her late 70s and living in Chicago, saw a headline that said,`Debbie's Show Goes Up in Smoke.' She was at a stage where she onlyread headlines. She called and asked if anyone was hurt in thefire.''   ``Father Dowling'' is the ninth series for Bosley, who also wona Tony for his title role in ``Fiorello!'' in 1959. He remainedactive on the New York stage until the mid-1960s, when he became apart of the repertory company for NBC's ``That Was the Week ThatWas.''   Next came ``The Debbie Reynolds Show,'' followed by ``The DeanMartin Show,'' ``The Sandy Duncan Show, ``Wait Till Your FatherComes Home'' (He was the voice of the father on this cartoon show),``Happy Days,'' ``That's Hollywood'' (as narrator) and ``Murder,She Wrote.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JERRY BUCK</NOTE><NOTE>AP Television Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scott Bakula, in his role astime-traveling Sam Beckett in NBC's ``Quantum Leap,'' never knowswho he will be from week to week.   Beckett, in fact, seldom knows who he is, or what he looks like,until he catches sight of himself in a mirror. Beckett, you see, isa scientist tap-dancing his way through time as the result of atime-travel experiment that went haywire.   Whenever he leaps in time he becomes a different person. Theaudience sees him as Beckett, but to people in the story he appearsas the other person. He must stay there, as that person, until hesolves a problem and leaps again in time.   He has been a teen-age hot rodder, a black man, a professor, atest pilot and assorted other identities. Next season he's a womanand a ghost-busting parapsychologist.   He's occasionally joined by his mentor, Albert, played by DeanStockwell. Albert, however, appears as a holographic projectionvisible only to Beckett and to the audience.   ``In one show I was a gangster hit man,'' he says. ``I popped inwith my pants around my ankles and a woman saying, `Frankie, youwere terrific.' Dean popped up a minute later.   ``It's great for me as an actor. Every show is so totallydifferent. Although we only travel within the lifetime of mycharacter, which is from 1953 to the present, we can do some periodstories with old cars and props. The hairdressers a couple of weeksago had to do 50 beehive hairdos every day.   ``It's a fun show to do. It has elements of `Peggy Sue GotMarried' and `Back To the Future.' The twist is I get to be insomebody else's shoes.''   Bakula, which rhymes with Dracula, is in Pasadena for an episodeset in a haunted mansion. The huge stone house, lined inside withmarble and filled with statuary, sits atop a hill across the ArroyoSeco from downtown Pasadena.   Donald Bellisario, executive producer and creator of ``QuantumLeap,'' and his wife, Deborah Pratt, the producer, are among thosein the show. Bellisario is his mirror image and Pratt is a womanwho hires the parapsychologist because she believes her latehusband's spirit is in the house.   ``Ideally, my own character of Sam Beckett shines through eachnew character every week,'' says Bakula. ``Don Bellisario haswritten Sam as a warm human being with a passion for his fellowman. Hopefully, that'll come through so I'll get involved withpeople.   ``I come into a situation, I don't know what's going on, thenhave to get acquainted and solve the problem. It's whimsical, yethas an element of sadness. Sam is lost in time. His life seems tobe ended. He lives his life as other people.''   Bakula says the offer to do the series came ``out of the blue.''He'd just returned from New York where he had appeared in themusical ``Romance, Romance.''   ``I got the script on a Wednesday and by Friday we had a deal,''he says. ``It was such a good script. I didn't know Don Bellisariobecause somehow I'd totally missed `Magnum, P.I.,' which was hisshow. So it was a surprise to get a script that good.''   ``Quantum Leap,'' which NBC has renewed for next season, isBakula's third TV series. He smiles and says, ``Knock on wood. Thethird time's a charm. It's awfully nice to be picked up. It'sdisappointing when a show fails. But both were great experiencesfor me.''   His first was ABC's ``Gung Ho'' in 1986-87, based on the hitmovie about the cultural clash when a Japanese car company opens afactory in Pennsylvania. He played the intermediary between theJapanese bosses and the American workers.   Next in 1988 was CBS' ``Eisenhower &amp; Lutz,'' a comedy created byAlan Burns, co-creator with Jim Brooks of ``The Mary Tyler MooreShow.'' He played Buddy Lutz, a slightly shady lawyer who adds thename of Eisenhower to his struggling, one-man law office in anattempt to add some class.   His first television appearance in many years was in the pilotepisode of CBS' ``Designing Women'' as Annie Potts' former husband.   ``I had been working in New York doing mostly theater work,'' hesays. ``The last television I'd done was `On Our Own' in 1977.Dixie Carter was in that and she's also in `Designing Women.' Itold her I only work in shows she's in.''   After his move here in January 1986, Bakula also worked on ``MySister Sam'' and ``Matlock'' and was in a television movie withJohn Ritter. He starred in a Disney TV movie pilot called``I-Man.'' He played a man who breathed radiated gas and becameindestructible.   ``I did a few soap opera things when I was in New York,'' hesays, ``but mostly I worked in the theater.''   Bakula met his wife, Krista, while on tour in Connecticut. Theywere both appearing in ``The Baker's Wife.'' They now have a5-year-old daughter and she has ``taken a leave of absence fromacting.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JILL LAWRENCE</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A baby sitter recently saved the lives ofeight young children by tossing them from the window of her burningapartment to the arms of rescuers three stories below.   There was heroism in the tale, but it also raised some questions.   Should one person have been looking after eight children rangingin age from 5 months to 3 years? Were the children getting theindividual attention considered vital to healthy child development?Even more basic, was the situation safe? And who's to blame for daycare that is abusive, hazardous, emotionally damaging orintellectually barren?   Day care for children traditionally has been regulated by theindividual states. Now Congress is debating whether to enactminimum federal standards and force states to toe the line.   No fewer than two dozen child care bills are pending on CapitolHill, with advocates of federal regulation insisting that somestates simply are not doing a proper job.   The controversy over federal encroachment on the turf of thestates was a major factor holding up child care legislation lastyear and the fireworks promise to be equally as lively this year.   Are states doing the job?   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who is leading a National GovernorsAssociation push for federal incentives instead of requirements,says, ``The record reflects a significant effort in most states toimprove child care standards.''   But officials of the Children's Defense Fund maintain there arewide discrepancies in the standards from state to state. In somestates, for example, a single adult cannot care for more than threeinfants. But in Idaho, a new mandatory licensing systemtheoretically permits one person to care for 12 infants.   ``The states that are generally moving forward are the ones thatweren't in such bad shape to begin with,'' says Helen Blank, daycare director for the CDF. ``But we still have a situation where inmany states licensing standards don't give children the protectionthey need to grow up safe _ much less give them a gooddevelopmental experience.   ``The bottom line is that a few states have gone backwards. Insome states, what they call progress makes you a littleuncomfortable.''   Meanwhile, President Bush is pushing for a tax break forlow-income families with young children, on the premise that itgives parents a choice.

There was heroism in the tale, but it also raised some questions.   Should one person have been looking after eight children rangingin age from 5 months to 3 years? Were the children getting theindividual attention considered vital to healthy child development?Even more basic, was the situation safe? And who's to blame for daycare that is abusive, hazardous, emotionally damaging orintellectually barren?   Day care for children traditionally has been regulated by theindividual states. Now Congress is debating whether to enactminimum federal standards and force states to toe the line.   No fewer than two dozen child-care bills are pending on CapitolHill, with advocates of federal regulation insisting that somestates simply are not doing a proper job.   The controversy over federal encroachment on the turf of thestates was a major factor holding up child-care legislation lastyear and the fireworks promise to be equally as lively this year.   Are states doing the job?   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who is leading a National GovernorsAssociation push for federal incentives instead of requirements,says, ``The record reflects a significant effort in most states toimprove child-care standards.''   But officials of the Children's Defense Fund maintain there arewide discrepancies in the standards from state to state. In somestates, for example, a single adult cannot care for more than threeinfants. But in Idaho, a new mandatory licensing systemtheoretically permits one person to care for 12 infants.   ``The states that are generally moving forward are the ones thatweren't in such bad shape to begin with,'' says Helen Blank, daycare director for the CDF. ``But we still have a situation where inmany states licensing standards don't give children the protectionthey need to grow up safe _ much less give them a gooddevelopmental experience.   ``The bottom line is that a few states have gone backwards. Insome states, what they call progress makes you a littleuncomfortable.''   Meanwhile, President Bush is pushing for a tax break forlow-income families with young children, on the premise that itgives parents a choice. One parent can decide to stay home or thefamily can use the money for the child care of their choice.   Bush's plan presumes that parents don't want or need federalintrusion in the day care field. Any federal requirements woulddecrease the supply of care and infringe on parental choice,backers of the plan contend.

Her group has identified three factors that most influencethe quality of day care interactions: group size, thestaff-to-child ratio, and staff training.   The federal government operates dozens of day care centers forits employees across the country and overseas, and many agencieswithout centers are now making on-sight child care a priority.   The Learning Center at the General Services Administration inWashington meets or betters nearly all standards recommended byprofessional groups and is serving as a model for that movement.   Director Pam Simon says other centers send their teachers toobserve the staff and organizers come to find out how to set upcenters at their agencies. ``We get people coming to look at us allthe time,'' she said.   Bredekamp of the NAEYC says proper training might have avertedthe recent death of a 9-month-old infant whose nanny banged herhead against the wall because she would not stop crying. ``We mustface the very real possibility that the nanny did not know anybetter,'' she says.

Upstairs, a 12-piece band belts out Mongolian hits from the 1930sas a more middle-aged crowd, some dressed in the traditionalrobe-like ``del'' and high black riding boots, swirl around the room.   Despite the isolation _ in the winter the capital of Ulan Batoris accessible only by plane from Moscow or a 30-hour train ride fromBeijing _ signs of Western influence are seeping into this stolidlysocialist nation of 2 million.   Foreign visitors must pay hotel and transportation bills withU.S. dollars and are frequently stopped on the street bymoney-changers offering twice the official dollar rate for theMongolian currency, the tugrik.   At the ``dollar store'' in Ulan Bator, Mongolians with Americanor other Western money listen to a tape from a San Francisco radiostation program while buying British whiskeys, American toiletriesand Japanese radios.   English, still rare in a country where studying Russian ismandatory, is now taught on prime-time national television with aseries arranged through the British Embassy.   The foreign influence, however, is predominantly Russian.Thousands of Soviets _ engineers, technical advisers, traders andsoldiers _ live and work in Ulan Bator. The visage of Lenin peersfrom statues and billboards around the city, and a war memorialjutting into the skyline from the top of a hill is dedicated toSoviet, not Mongolian soldiers.   Central Ulan Bator _ which means ``Red Hero'' _ is a collectionof Soviet-financed columned government buildings and utilitarianapartment complexes, most painted in pleasant pastel shades of pinkand yellow. Mongolia must import most of its consumer goods, and 80percent of its trade is with the Soviet Union.   Mongolia adopted the Russian Cyrillic script in 1946, and allschoolchildren must study Russian from the fourth grade on. Study ofthe Mongolian script, suppressed for decades, was revived about fouryears ago, but classes only begin in the seventh grade.   Signs in the native script are rare, in contrast to Chinese InnerMongolia, where shops and offices frequently carry signs inMongolian for the Mongolian minority of 3 million.   About 6,000 Mongolian university and research students, thenation's best and brightest, study in the Soviet Union.   The dependence on Soviet political and cultural reinforcementgoes back to 1921, when Soviet forces helped Mongolia drive out theChinese who had occupied the country for more than 200 years and setup the world's second Communist state.   Soviet-style socialism was in part Mongolia's salvation, creatinga well-cared-for and well-educated nation. The cost to Mongolianheritage, however, was high.   At the turn of the century the Mongolian population was only500,000 and in danger of being wiped out. Literacy was about 1percent. Forty percent of the male population lived in the nation's750 Buddhist lamaseries, one reason for the declining population.   A Stalinist purge of the 1930s resulted in the closure of allmonasteries and the murder of many monks. Today the Gandan Monasteryin Ulan Bator, with 160 monks, is the only functioning Buddhisttemple in the country.   In the 1940s, the Mongolian script was suppressed and in the1950s there was a campaign to ban wearing of the native costume.   Plans to celebrate the 800th birthday of the great Mongol warriorGenghis Khan in 1962 were scaled down as a result of Sovietdispleasure.   Mongolian culture persists in both the ``del,'' the usual form ofdress in the countryside, and the ``ger,'' or ``yurt,'' the round,canvas-colored tent which is still home to about half Ulan Bator's500,000 people.   In the countryside, semi-nomadic herding remains the main way oflife despite collectivization of their herds of sheep, horses, cowsand camels.   ``We need more settled animal husbandry to supply cities withmeat and milk,'' says O. Shagdarsuren, rector of the Mongolian StateUniversity.   But Shagdarsuren, who grew up in a herdsman's family, saidMongolia should keep its nomadic ways. ``In settled husbandry peoplelive for the animals. In nomadic husbandry, the animals are alwaysworking for man.''   Mongolia is also working to ensure that its human population,which occupies only a tiny part of this Western Europe-sized nationof steppes, deserts, forestland and mountains, will continue to grow.   A mother giving birth to her fourth child receives a 15-dayvacation at a state rest house and is eligible for retirement at 50.Further births means greater salary and pension benefits, and awoman with eight children is awarded a ``first class medal of famousmothers.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JIM ABRAMS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iowa farmer and hunter Norbert Bremertraveled 10,000 miles and spent $10,000 to get a shot at a ram onthe frozen, wind-lashed wasteland of the Gobi desert.   ``I had a wonderful time,'' says Bremer, showing off the mightycurved horns of a Gobi ram, his trophy from one of the world's moreexotic safaris.   He is one of some 350 hunters (out of 600 who apply) whom theMongolians allowed in last year. They control the number to preservethe wildlife.   Bremer, 52, also tracked down a tall-horned Siberian ibex as partof the tour, and, for an extra $750, shot a blacktailed gazelle.   He was the last hunter of 1988 to take the Gobi tour. He saidtemperatures in the Mongolian desert plunged to zero, and the windknifed through the treeless scrub at 30 mph.   Bremer, who farms 880 acres of corn and soybeans in Ocheyedan,Iowa, says he read of the Gobi hunt in hunting magazines. For about$6,500 the Mongolian tourist agency, Zhuulchin, provided in-countrytransportation, guides and attendants, and a license to shoot oneGobi sheep and one ibex.   Bremer had to get here on his own, via Beijing.   He also paid a fee of $200 dollars for every inch of the ram'shorn in excess of 43{ inches.   His kill had horns of 51 inches, which Bremer said may make therecord books.   But the experience was more than the hunt. His party passednomadic herdsmen, some armed with rifles and riding camels andhorses as they tended their herds and flocks in the parched bush.   The hunters lived in a yurt, the round tent-like home ofMongolian herdsmen, and were served by an interpreter, a driver, acook, a camp manager and a young woman who tended the stoves andskinned the animals.   The tourist agency also offers safaris to the woodlands ofcentral and northeast Mongolia, where elk, moose, deer and brownbear abound.   G. Batsukh, deputy general director of Zhuulchin, said severalyears ago the government sold licenses to hunt the rare andbeautiful snow leopard found in the Altai range, claiming theleopard population had increased and was preying on cattle, yaks andpeople. But he said only one or two of the white and black leopardswere killed, and shooting licenses are no longer issued.	
</TEXT><NOTE>By JIM ABRAMS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Like its huge and dominant neighborto the north, this ancient nation of herdsmen and miners, once ruledby Genghis Khan, is restructuring its Marxist society.   But what the Soviets call perestroika, the Mongolians call``shinechel'' or renewal. And they are greeting the liberation ofthe state-controlled economy and the infusion of democracy with anair of excitement.   The old ways brought shortages in a land of plenty and politicaltimidity to a people of great warrior tradition.   Shinechel is still too new to claim many accomplishments, butthere are great expectations.   ``Before, we said that capitalism and socialism can't existtogether,'' says Puntagdasyn Luvsandorj, director of the Instituteof Economics of the State Planning Committee. ``Now we say they mustcooperate.''   The main target of reform is the state monopoly on productionimposed in the 1960s on both industry and, more improbably, in ruralareas where people are scattered across a nation nearly the size ofWestern Europe, wandering the grasslands as semi-nomadic herdsmen.   One consequence is that livestock numbers have stagnated at about23 million head since the early 1970s even though the humanpopulation has doubled, to about 2 million.   Half of the meat produced must be exported to the Soviet Union topay for Soviet goods and financial aid, leaving city residents tostand in line, sometimes for hours, for scarce supplies of meat, thestaple of the Mongolian diet.   More than half the population has left the harsh life on thegrasslands for cities, putting further strains on food supplies.   ``The food situation is getting worse,'' said one foreigndiplomat, noting that grain and vegetable farms, all run by thestate, are plagued by ``bad planning, bad management and badprofits.''   The government is now trying to spur meat production byincreasing the private stocks herdsmen are allowed to keep. Those inthe Gobi desert region can now keep 100 head, while those in otherparts of the country can keep 75. Farmers may now work small privateplots.   Industry has fared better because of heavy investment andtechnical assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialistnations, helping Mongolia develop its rich mineral resources.   In December, Mongolia's parliament passed an industrial lawgiving factory directors greater authority over planning andinvestment. But it's three strikes and you're out. The governmentwill bail out money-losing enterprises only two times before theyare shut down.   ``Before, we didn't participate in selling our product, so wewere not interested in quality and meeting world competition,'' saidChimedeeren Erdenechimeg, general engineer at a carpet factory inUlan Bator. ``Now, according to the new law, if we produce a goodproduct and can find a market, the living conditions of the managersand workers will improve.''   Free markets, encouraged by the government, are still small butgrowing. Owners of private cars have gone into the taxi service, afew small restaurants have appeared and private clothesmakers areselling to retail cooperatives.   But the pace of economic change is likely to be slow, said oneforeign diplomat. ``It's such a vast country,'' he said, and ``thereis little pressure from below for privatization'' because people arerelatively prosperous and have known nothing but socialism since theMarxist state was founded in 1921, only four years after the Russianrevolution, making it the second oldest Marxist society in the world.   Faster change may come in the political sphere, where the rulingCommunist Party is debating an election law that for the first timewill allow direct multi-candidate elections.   The party is also trying to limit the role of party officials topolicy-making, and streamline the government. ``Marx and Lenin saidthe roles of the party, the government and mass organizations shouldbe separate,'' said Kinayat Zardihan, a leading ideologist in theparty's Institute of Social Sciences. ``But in our country thisdifference has disappeared.''   As in the Soviet Union, the official press is encouraged tocondemn what are now regarded as errors of the past. The press nowspeaks openly about repression and political purges in the 1930s.Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, ruler for 40 years until his ouster in 1984,is knocked for forcing collectivization in the 1960s while hisRussian wife is criticized for wielding too much power.   Statues in Ulan Bator of Stalin, and other native oppressors,have recently been smeared with paint.   Zardihan said the party is now rewriting the nation's history toinclude the truth about events that have shaped the nation.   One government official noted that before now everything thathappened before 1921 was regarded as bad, including the 12th and13th century advance of Genghis Khan's horsemen that created aMongol Empire stretching from the Danube to the coast of China.   President and party leader Jambyn Batmonh, a 62-year-old formerrector of the state university, is also hoping to ease his remoteand landlocked nation away from its near total dependence on theSoviet Union and other Soviet bloc nations.   Relations with China, with which Mongolia shares a 2,900-mileborder, show signs of improvement as Moscow and Beijing patch up olddifferences. Mongolia, which sided with the Soviet Union when itstwo giant neighbors split in 1960, sent home one division of Soviettroops in 1987 and has now pledged to remove a ``considerablenumber'' of the remaining 50,000 Soviet troops guarding Mongoliafrom a potential Chinese attack.   In early 1987, Mongolia and the United States establisheddiplomatic relations and are now negotiating cultural and consularagreements.   Currently 97 percent of Mongolia's total annual trade of about$1.6 billion is with socialist countries, 80 percent with the SovietUnion. Those figures will be hard to change in the near future.Mongolia receives about a billion dollars in aid and two-thirds ofits capital investment funds from the Soviet Union every year, whichlocks it into shipping its ores, cashmere and meat to the socialistbloc.   Officially, at least, Mongolians are full of praise for theSoviet Union, which helped build its cities and industry.   Under Soviet-style socialism, Mongolia has become a nation ofalmost 100 percent literacy where 25 percent receive highereducations. Medical and other welfare facilities are inexpensive andworker incomes average nearly 200 dollars a month, one of the higherfigures in Asia.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JOHN BARBOUR</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Terry Weber, a soft-spoken sharpshooter inthis Midwestern city, sometimes answers the door with a gun on herhip. On the firing range, she practices her marksmanship againstreal-life assailants with wax bullets.   In New York City, where a woman jogger was attacked and raped bya roving gang in Central Park, Thalia Adams, 32, practicesregularly at a pistol range. She has twice been the victim of armedrobbery since she moved to Manhattan from Palo Alto, Calif.   Marie Mann, an insurance executive in Cincinnati, has a.380-caliber Bersea. She practices with it in her back yard. Butwould she use it to shoot an intruder or an attacker? She's notsure.   But when a woman takes to shooting, it's usually for reasons ofself-defense, not sport.   No one knows how many women carry handguns on the streets in theUnited States. By some estimates, however, as many as 12 million,one out of eight, have handguns in their homes.   There are no reliable statistics. Neither the Justice Departmentnor the Treasury's department for alcohol and firearms keepsrecords of women who are licensed to carry or own firearms or whorun afoul of the law by their use.   But firing ranges around the country report a significantincrease in the number of female members in the past four years.For instance, Lt. John Benner, who started the Tactical TrainingCenter in Cincinnati, says women once comprised only about 15percent to 20 percent of his beginning classes. Now they amount toabout 50 percent.   Sharon Sullivan, a Cincinnati attorney, can knock a clay pigeonout of the sky on the skeet range at the Moonlight Gun and HuntClub, but she doesn't carry her handgun on the street and wondersabout the wisdom of using it in self-defense. Nevertheless, she'sconvinced police are no longer sufficient protection.   Indeed, police all over the country have told citizens that theyhave an obligation to maintain order and enforce the laws, but theycannot defend every citizen's life or safety every minute of everyday. Citizens must take some responsibility. And indeed the courtshave upheld them.   Some women have taken the warning seriously. They are out therehefting their .44-caliber Magnums from the West Side Rifle andPistol Range in New York City to the Beverly Hills Gun Club inCalifornia. Some even graduate, for sport, to AK-47s and otherautomatic weapons.   Noting the trend, Smith and Wesson has brought out the LadySmith, a version of its popular .38-caliber, scaled down to fit awoman's hand. Another firm, Charter Arms, is offering a his-and-herpair of .38s called the Bonnie (Parker) and the Clyde (Barrow), theBonnie being scaled down in grip and trigger action.   There are all kinds of new products for the would-be gun-toter,including a a little gun for joggers. It fires right through itswallet-holster.   Polls by women's magazines have shown that women are often thesecret victims of crime, and have bought guns for security. ALadies Home Journal poll in 1987 found that 40 percent of 104,000women queried kept guns at home strictly for protection, and 42percent said they had been victims of crime.   Paxton Quigley in her new book, ``Armed &amp; Female,'' acomprehensive look at women and guns, the law and self-defense,says chances of being raped at any age in New York are one ineight; Los Angeles, one in seven; Atlanta, one in five; Detroit,one in four.   ``Across our nation, one out of every four families will bevictims of serious crimes like burglary, rape, robbery or murder,''says Quigley, who estimates that 12 million women have guns intheir homes. ``A Gallup Poll finds that six out of 10 women in thiscountry are afraid to walk in their own neighborhoods at night.''   Quigley, a native of California, was once an anti-gun activist.Then, she says, ``Two things happened in a week's time that changedmy mind. About 2{ years ago a girlfriend of mine heard someone comein her bathroom window about 1 o'clock in the morning. She called911, and waited. She didn't know what to do. It happened veryquickly and the damage was done. The police came 10 minutes later.''   The same week she read a story about a woman who thwarted anintruder with her own .38-caliber special and held the cringingwould-be attacker at gunpoint until the police arrived.   ``But she'd stopped a crime from happening while my girlfriendwas raped. Now 2{ years later she's still not well. So I decided itwas time for me to get a gun.''   Other women coming to the same conclusion have another criticaldecision to make. Should they leave the gun at home, or defy thelaw by carrying it?   Gun activists are careful not to encourage women to carry guns.   If a woman _ or a man _ kills someone who is clearly menacingher life, chances are they will get off by pleading self-defense, awoman especially because of the ``disparity of force'' between herand her attacker.   But no one can avoid the charge of illegal possession of ahandgun, and in most places could face a year in prison. BernardGoetz, New York's subway shooter, is a case in point. He wasacquitted of shooting his young attackers, but jailed forpossession of the instrument of force.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JOHN BARBOUR</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Beware the telephone.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here in the birthplace of the Grange, arecent regional meeting of the farmers' organization grew boisterouswhen about 60 members showed up. It reminded Charles David Fryer ofthe good old days.   ``That's the way it used to be when I joined,'' says Fryer,Grange No. 1's master or chief presiding officer,   That was in the early 1950s, a time when the local Grange hallwas the social center of many rural communities in America and theorganization had 880,000 members nationally. The Grange, in thosedays, was a prime force in the movement to modernize life outsidethe cities.   Now, the National Grange for the Patrons of Husbandry, which wasformed in this picturesque town in western New York shortly afterthe Civil War, appears to be dying on the vine, its membershipdwindling and aging.   A typical bimonthly meeting of the Fredonia chapter draws onlyabout 10 to 20 members.   ``We're down to 101 members,'' says Fryer, noting that 15 yearsago there were more than 300. ``We've lost a lot of members throughdeath and we've had a lot of members drop out because they've justlost interest.''   The Grange _ one of the first fraternal organizations to stressfamily membership and the participation of women as equals with men_ is now down to about 335,000 members nationally.   ``Our losses go along with other fraternal organizations,'' saysthe Grange's national president, Robert Barrow. ``People are justnot getting involved. There are too many things going on in thecommunity.''   A lack of community activities in small towns helped fuel theGrange's growth after Oliver Hudson Kelley and six others organizedthe first Grange in 1868. By 1872, there were more than 1,000chapters.   The Grange was organized to help unite farmers from the North andSouth following the Civil War and provide a family orientedfraternal organization to improve the economic and social positionof the farm population.   The Granges became political forums, seeking to correct economicabuses through cooperative enterprise. The organization pushed alegislative agenda that would chalk up some impressive successes:rural electrification, free rural mail delivery, the federal highwaysystem. The ``Granger Laws'' regulating railroads and grain storagefacilities established the constitutional principle of publicregulation of private utilities.   But the Grange hall also provided a variety of social activities_ dances, dinners, contests, shows, sales and games _ that made themeetings the place to be to have fun in many small communities.   Grange member Grace Reifler recalls: ``Years ago, you didn't havetelevision. To go out a couple of nights a month was a big event. Itwas a social affair.''   ``Our Grange was filled. They were all filled,'' said Claire, a63-year member who asked that her last name not be used. ``We hadyoung people, parents, kids up to the age where they were old enoughto join. We used to have a good time.''   Change came after World War II. Radio, and then television,provided in-house entertainment. Young people began to desert thesmall towns for the big cities and the farm population began todecline.   A big blow to the Grange came in the 1950s, when it was no longernecessary to join in order to purchase low-cost insurance. Memberswho had joined specifically for the insurance left and Grangemembership began to fall.   In New York, a large share of the 25,000 members are seniorcitizens.   ``I would say more than half are over age 60,'' Morse says.``We're not taking in the age group we need now.''   This helps create an image problem that Granger Blanche Rice runsinto when she talks with her grandchildren about joining.   ``You know what their answer is?'' she says. ``Why would we wantto hang around a bunch of old people?''   Linda Kesby, 39, says most of the 16 members in her Grange inEllery, N.Y. ``are a great deal older and they're having to decidewhat they want to do about the Grange.''   If they do join, younger members often find many older membersresistant to change and new ideas, according to Joe Trask, master ofthe Grange in Hamburg, N.Y.   ``One Grange got some younger people in and they got the ideathey would make some money for the treasury by holding a squaredance,'' Trask recalls. ``The older members said, `Wait a minute, wejust paid to have this floor refinished. You're not going to scratchthat floor with a square dance. Tunnel vision.''   Neva Woolley, deputy state master, adds, ``I think it's a realproblem. You constantly hear, `Well, we don't do it this way, we'vealways done it this way.' I think change is essential. We're in achanging world and you have to keep up with the times.''   One change that Barrow said had a ``50-50 chance'' of beingimplemented is a modification in the Grange's rituals, which dateback to its formation and which some younger members don't see asnecessary. ``Some of it has to be brought up to modern-daylanguage,'' he says.   Most members aren't against some ritual change, but it's notlikely the Grange will remove its prohibition against alcohol.   ``I don't think the members will ever change that,'' Barrow says.   Grange leaders have organized a youth leadership program whichhas met with some success.   ``We went to a youth conference in February and there were over100 young Grangers there under the age of 25,'' Kesby says. ``Andthey were very enthusiastic, wanting to get the Grange going more intheir area.''   The Grange's long-standing policy of letting other communityorganizations and groups use its local halls for their activitiesmay also help draw in non-members such as Gerri Centenella.   She has been conducting fitness classes out of the Fredonia halland was attending the regional meeting with her husband.   ``They told me to just come and see what it was like,'' she says.After the meeting, she said she was considering joining.   The odds seem long, however, that the Grange will recover its oldglory. As one local leader put it, unless changes are made to bringin younger members, ``by the year 2010, we'll be extinct.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JOHN KEKIS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Sports Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LITTLE FALLS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lorrie Keefe doesn't know what to dowith herself this summer. ``Maybe I'll take up jogging,'' shechuckles.   Lorrie Keefe is a die-hard baseball fan, and she's not had muchto chuckle about lately. The outlook is bleak for baseball fans inthis village tucked in the rolling hills of the Mohawk Valley. A sadsilence has fallen on the patrons of the game: Mighty Casey hasstruck out.   The Casey in question, however, isn't the Mudville slugger fromErnest Thayer's classic poem. It's Michael Casey, who bought theLittle Falls Mets last year and, when a better opportunity knocked,decided to strike out for his hometown of Pittsfield, Mass., ratherthan have his team play here at Veterans' Park, a field of dreams ifever there was one.   Michael Casey does have one thing in common with the smugslugger, Keefe says: His sense of timing _ it's mighty ``rotten.''   ``I didn't want to believe it at first,'' says the 53-year-oldKeefe, who lives a couple of blocks from the ballpark and onlymissed a handful of home games in the 12 years the Mets played here.``There's really nothing much to do in this town. It was reallyquite a thrill having 'em here.   ``I hate to look at it rationally. But when you spend that muchmoney (Casey shelled out $230,000) for an A team, and being as wewere noted as the smallest city in the whole United States as havinga franchise, I suppose I could see his point. But he certainlydidn't do it in a very good way. He could have given us a chance toget another team in here.''   Despite losing money in his first season as an owner, Caseyintended to stay in Little Falls for at least one more year.However, that quickly changed when the Pittsfield Cubs of the ClassAA Eastern League decided to move last September.   ``We realized after the loss we experienced that we were going tobe treating this as a business,'' Casey says, sitting in his officeat Pittsfield's Wahconah Park. ``We knew, and we were very upfrontwith the people over there, that long-term we just couldn't see usstaying in Little Falls because of the investment that was made.   ``We thought the Cubs would be here, but when it opened up weacted, and we acted in a hurry.''   That happened in mid-December, and Little Falls was left withouta team at the worst possible time.   ``We thought at least if he stayed for the '89 season that wouldgive us a chance to look,'' says Mayor Michael Izzo.   Casey may not have given them that chance, but his decision tomove to Pittsfield (population 50,000) appears to have been aprudent one businesswise.   Despite its awful reputation, Wahconah Park (in the past, gameshave had to be delayed because the sun sets directly behind centerfield and batters were unable to see the speeding ball) is lookinggood these days. It's got a fresh paint job _ in the Mets' colors,of course _ a new infield, new scoreboard, billboards galore, and ascreen in center field to block out the sunsets.   Casey hopes to draw at least 50,000 for the season, which iscrammed in from mid-June to the end of August. Little Falls drewjust under 30,000 to rank in the middle of the New York-Penn Leaguein attendance last season.   In one sense, Little Falls is a victim of a not-so-pleasant trendin minor-league baseball.   ``It seems to be going toward the bigger cities,'' says OneontaYankees owner Sam Nader, who's been in the business for almost ahalf-century. ``If we're really saying that baseball is America'sgame, better not forget the people in the provinces. The days wherethe community people are involved seem to be going by the boards.Now we're getting entrepreneurs and people who are in it for egotrips or whatever. It makes it extremely difficult for the smallcommunity, which has been the backbone of this great sport, tosurvive.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ST. MARYS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Just across the tracks from the antebellumcharm of historic St. Marys, where old oaks drip Spanish moss, a newnuclear submarine base is changing the face of the countryside withshopping malls and low-cost housing.   The Kings Bay Submarine Base, to be home to the Trident subs,means stability, money and lots of jobs in this area on thesoutheastern tip of Georgia, just north of Jacksonville, Fla. Butthe boom also is bringing urban-style headaches to rural CamdenCounty.   The base, under construction for a decade, will add more than22,000 people to the population of Camden County, which had onlyabout 13,000 in 1980.   Planners are worried about schools, crime, water and sewersystems, libraries, fire protection and recreational facilities.   The county had no movie theater until recently. Now a six-theatercinema complex has opened in a shopping center and another isprobable for a center being built down the road.   The county's landfill, projected to last up to 40 years, was usedup in 10 because of the base-related boom.   From 1980 to 1988, school enrollment in the area increased 54percent. Projections show that in 1995, enrollment will be 173percent above the 1980 level.   Backers of the base say the Navy is trying hard to be a goodneighbor.   Even so, says Roger Alderman of the Kings Bay Impact CoordinatingCommittee, ``The degree that it affects a small area, especially onesuch as Camden County, is unimaginable.''   The first Trident submarine was to arrive at the $1.7 billionbase on Jan. 14, welcomed in an invitation-only ceremony.   Eventually the base will house 10 Trident subs, each carrying 24missiles packing eight nuclear warheads per missile. Each warhead is35 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima,Japan, in 1945.   Each submarine will have more atomic destructive capacity thanmost nuclear powers, but if the people of St. Marys are nervousabout that, it is subdued. The few protests held at the base havenot been locally organized.   Over the centuries _ up to now _ residents of St. Marys havepreserved its charm with a minimum of tackiness.   The Spanish settled the community in 1566 and stayed 120 years.Aaron Burr came to town in 1804 after killing Alexander Hamilton ina duel. In the 1930s, cartoonist Roy Crane visited and was so takenby the town streetcar that he used it as a model for his``Toonerville Trolly.''   Visitors to St. Marys once got the impression that anythingdestined to happen here happened long ago. The nearness of the baseis changing that.   Crime is up, although local officials blame transientconstruction workers, not the military, for most of it.   Low-cost housing developments are popping up everywhere. Onlyabout 600 Navy personnel, mostly in the lower ranks, will be housedon the base.   Fields and pine woods have given way to shopping malls, and themushrooming strip of development along Highway 40 is cheek by jowlwith the city limits.   Tom Sterling, 80, runs the grocery store his father founded morethan 100 years ago in St. Marys.   ``We used to sell everything here, from horse collars on up, ormaybe I should say on down,'' he says.   Old friends stop by to pass the time and remember when.   But the shelves are thinly stocked these days and customers arefew. Malls and shopping centers built for the base trade, Sterlingsays, are drawing shoppers from St. Marys' few businesses as well.   In the basement of Orange Hall, a Greek Revival splendor from the1820s, Elvira Wildes tends a small information center.   The Navy, she says, has gone out of its way to put the base in apositive light, especially to St. Marys' older residents.   `They come to tell us the facts,'' she says. ``They told us it isthe only Navy base being started from scratch. They give us tours onthe ships, and we eat in the mess hall sometimes.   ``If there is dirt and trash going on, and if there are peopleacting like they shouldn't, well I don't go to those places so Idon't know about those things.''   There is no entertainment in St. Marys, she observes correctly.``So why would they bother us?''   ``It is not an adversarial relationship,'' agrees Kenneth Kent, afinancial analyst with the Coordinating Committee, which is tryingto soften the impact of the base on the area. ``The Navy is tryingto be a good neighbor.''   Alderman says the federally funded committee, made up of localgovernment leaders, ``is to lay out the realities of a high-growtharea and foresee problems down the road.''   The area has received some $37.5 million in federal impactpayments since 1984. Alderman says Washington wanted to make 1989the last year for impact funding.   ``We estimate we would need $8.7 million in 1991 and $5.3 millionin 1992,'' he says. ``The Navy isn't even thinking in terms of 1991or 1992.''   Kent says a residential tax base generally is not sufficient tosupport residential services.   ``There is virtually no industrial tax base here and only anominal commercial base,'' he says.   Much of the county is in timber, which is taxed at a low rate andthus provides little county income, he says.   The county school tax already is 9 percent above that of othercounties in the region, he says, and Camden County cannot absorbeven the matching portions of the increased cost.   ``The current tax situation allows counties to keep up existingschools but not to build new ones required by the increase inpopulation,'' Kent says.   ``A high percentage of the jobs on the base were to go to thelocal people but this has not happened the way it was expected to,''Alderman says.   Because special skills are needed for many jobs, he says, CamdenCounty area residents generally have gotten lower-paying jobs towardthe service end of the scale.   ``Both the Navy and the region realize the need for ajob-training program,'' he says.   Alderman says Navy officials at St. Marys are aware of theproblems and are trying to get Washington to do more.   ``The critical point is at hand,'' Alderman says. ``We have foundout now what has to be done.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>EAGLESWOOD TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   To the nature buff, NewJersey's Pinelands are miles of pygmy pines, deep forest, creeksand bogs.   To romantics, the Pinelands might be symbolized by the Waretowncabin where fiddler George Albert once played through the night, orthe general store in Chatsworth that still offers a table forcoffee and gossip.   In folklore, it's the birthplace of the Jersey Devil, a placewhere men live in caves and marry their sisters.   But to some landowners, ``Pinelands'' is only a title, anannoying federal designation that stifles development and profit.   In reality, the more than 1.1 million acres comprising thePinelands in southern New Jersey are a unique medley of tremendoushistorical and environmental significance.   Ringed by the urban sprawl that gave New Jersey a bad name, theregion gained national recognition in November 1978 when PresidentJimmy Carter signed the National Parks and Recreation Act thatincluded the creation of the Pinelands National Reserve.   Carter's act stopped any talk of a supersonic jetport in themiddle of this vast space, a frightening prospect for an areaalready being invaded by the rush of metropolitan housingdevelopers.   Ten years ago, it seemed that nothing within two hours of NewYork City would be left untouched.   But the Pinelands reserve, the largest remaining open tract inthe mid-Atlantic states, was saved.   In a unique arrangement, the state of New Jersey manages thefederal reserve, keeping large-scale development in outlying areasand maintaining the undisturbed nature of thousands of acres in themiddle. The state, with federal financial help, is slowly buyingproperty to add to the total reserve, most of which is stillprivately owned.   The state Pinelands Commission now operates with a managementplan that is both commended and condemned. In addition, 56municipalities within the Pinelands are involved in modifying theirmaster development plans to make them conform with the goals of theprotection effort.   ``When the Pinelands plan developed, there had to beaccommodations, and some people were hurt and some people werehelped,'' says Pearl Schwartz of Toms River, a member of the OceanCounty Environmental Agency and the Ocean Nature Society.   ``But the overall picture that has emerged in 10 years has beenon the side of good. We have been able to control growth, which isnot happening in the rest of the state.''   More than 100 years ago, the parts of Atlantic, Burlington,Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties thatare now the Pinelands made up a prosperous region filled with iron,charcoal and glass industries utilizing the bountiful rawmaterials. In later years, sawmills and wineries flourished.   Today, only the names of Colonial-era villages remain, alongwith remnants of the ``Piney'' lifestyle. Few still follow thetradipine cones, clams andsphagnum moss to live off the land.   ``The Pinelands heritage is going to die off very soon,'' saysKenneth Yates, a Tabernacle blueberry farmer who grew up amonggenerations of Pineys. ``We don't even have much of a historicalsociety anymore. The young people don't want to get involved.   ``Older homes are getting torn down, because the youngergeneration is not about to live primitive. And people are stillliving in the woods, but with all the modern conveniences.''   Some southern New Jersey natives are flattered to be called a``Piney.'' But not others.   ``A Piney is a three-headed incestuous idiot that can't walk ortalk,'' says Joe Horner, a member of a Pinelands band. ``We are`indigenous' residents _ born here, raised here, growed up here andwill die here. Pineys are people who moved here from Brooklyn tolive off the land.''   Russ Horner, picking on a guitar nearby, chimes in: ``The wholething is a hoax. The idea of people stumbling around the Pinelandspicking sphagnum moss for a living is nice, but it's not hardlyreal anymore.''   Horner points to his Uncle Joe, who builds wooden boats inWaretown and was dubbed a ``Piney'' by newspaper reporters whowrote about him and his craft.   ``Joe turns out classic garveys made out of Atlantic whitecedar, but he ain't no Piney,'' Horner says.   Ask Joe Reid himself, and he somewhat bashfully agrees.   ``Growing up here, we didn't know this would ever be called `thePinelands,''' he says. ``We used to call it `back in the woods.'''   Although the lifestyle may wane, action has been taken toprotect the Pinelands' physical attributes, which include a vastunderground aquifer, with an estimated 17 trillion gallons of purewater, and rare cedar and pygmy pines. In 1983, the United Nationsdesignated the region an ``International Biosphere Reserve.''   The Pinelands Management Plan protects a fragile core, and getsincreasingly less restrictive as it moves outward. Some areas aredesignated for agriculture. Others are forest areas that permitlow-density residential and commercial development.   Larger communities already within the reserve have beenclassified as ``regional growth areas,'' where most futuredevelopment will concentrate.   But the director of the state Pinelands Commission, TerrenceMoore, emphasizes that no part of the reserve will see any majorproject, such as a toxic waste dump, that could taint theenvironment.   In the process of protecting such a vast tract in a rapidlydeveloping region, the state frustrated many landowners who facedrestrictions on their ability to use or profit from their property.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>HAZLET, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A honey bee would likely have a nervousbreakdown if trapped inside a New Jersey fragrance factory wherescientists are constantly in search of new scents to sell.   An overwhelming odor fills the plant of International Flavorsand Fragrances. It is the mingled essence of hundreds ofconcentrated odors released into the air when workers opencanisters filled with rare ingredients that are blended to create adesired smell.   Sweet orange and rare rose oils compete with spicy vanilla andcinnamon. A lovely lavender scent tangles in the air with thewoodsy odor of moss.   IFF scientists have devised scents for detergent companies thatask for something ``fresh'' or ``clean.'' They put the smell inproducts that range from household air fresheners to expensiveperfumes.   IFF researchers also have faced some unusual challenges, sayscompanmy spokesman William G. Dalton. When the Philadelphia Zoowanted to let children experience all their senses in its new``Treehouse'' exhibit, IFF devised a ``dinosaur vegetation''fragrance.   When the owner of a shopping mall bakery was overwhelmed by theomnipresent odor of a pizza shop next door, ``he needed sensorycompetition,'' Dalton says. ``We developed a smell for fresh-bakedgoods, and it worked.''   In 1988, IFF, which employs 4,800 people in 36 countries,reported net sales of $839.5 million and a net income of $128.7million. The company touts itself as the ``ghostwriter'' to itsclients, refusing to identify any of the famous brands offragrances the company has developed.   Not everyone is impressed with the smells, though.Environmentalists and local residents have complained about noxiousodors and discharges into the Raritan Bay, prompting stateenvironmental officials to impose fines.   At times, those fines have been stiff, including a $1.25 millionpenalty in October 1986 for groundwater pollution. In view of theproblems, the company is modifying its monitoring equipment as thefacility continues to grow.   The business of fragrance boomed when federal health officialsbanned the use of an anti-bacterial ingredient in soaps that killedodor-causing bacteria, Dalton says.   ``Fragrance was the natural substitute,'' Dalton says.   But the fascination with fragrance is hardly a new phenomenon.In February, archaeologists dug up a 2,000-year-old flask of oilthat might have been used to anoint ancient Israelite kings.   Today, scents are found in advertising strips between the pagesof magazines, in most every brand of shampoo and even in plastictoys.   ``We have not seen any indication that there is too muchfragrance on the market,'' Dalton says. ``People get excited by newfragrances. As long as it's pleasing, it's acceptable.''   To get public reaction to a newly developed scent, IFF hireslocal residents ``to smell a variety of different things in avariety of ways, whether on skin or cloth or whatever,'' says IraKatz, director of research and development. ``We're not necessarilyinterested in whether they personally like it, but whether itcovers a malodor, such as body odor or kitchen odor.''   Testers in cubicles _ mostly women _ take quick sniffs fromsmall jars, then record the overall intensity of each. In someinstances, the testers have sniffed forearms, smelled dank laundryor even hovered over a row of smelly garbage cans.   In IFF's compounding facility next door, employees look likechefs as they mix oils, crystals and other liquids instainless-steel buckets and tanks to produce concentrates ofvarious fragrances. The ``recipes'' are top-secret and divided upamong several employees to protect the secrecy of a customer'sformula, says Ted Trembley, general manager of the IFF compoundingfacility.   The fragrance compounds are then shipped to a customer's ownplant, where they are mixed with other ingredients to create thecompleted product.   The raw ingredients used to produce an individual fragrance varyin their rarity. Bulgarian ``rose otto,'' for instance, is perhapsthe most expensive _ it takes one ton of rose petals to make abouttwo pounds of the intensely strong-smelling oil worth more than$5,000, Trembley says.   The high cost of natural ingredients such as sandalwood andexotic flowers has led IFF researchers to devise methods ofartificially reproducing scents.   The scientists also have devised a method to capture a scent inits natural state _ the most desirable intensity, Trembley says.   ``A fresh flower does not have the same molecular structureafter it is cut,'' he says.   To duplicate those exact scents, scientists use a portablemechanism that can be taken anywhere, from the tiny greenhouse onthe roof of IFF headquarters to a large field of flowers in Europe.   The method involves placing a small glass globe over a flowerand using a simple pump to draw the air around the blossom into asmall tube, says Robert Trenkle, a senior project chemist.   An absorbent material in the tube captures the ``aromamolecules,'' and the material is then analyzed with a spectrometerto determine its primary components.   ``The trickiest part is putting all the components back togetherand coming up with the same scent,'' Trenkle says.   A flower's scent, he says, is an ``elaborate mixture ofchemicals being emitted...usually to attract an insect. A flower'sodor is not for us to enjoy. It's for a much more importantreason.''   In the past decade, IFF has concentrated on capturing thousandsof fragrance ``notes'' and reproducing them for the benefit of thehuman nose, Dalton says. Some fine perfumes, he says, may becombined from 1,500 ingredients.   ``Our perfumers are very creative people,'' he says. ``They areactually artists starting with a blank canvas, developing afragrance from zero.''   Despite the technological advances made in creating new scentsand synthetically reproducing scents, Dalton acknowledges that onepart of IFF's scientific and creative process will probably neverbe duplicated.   ``We can test our products only with the human nose,'' he says.``And even then, it's still very subjective.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JUDIE GLAVE</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Across New York Harbor from Manhattan's eleganttowers, the turnaround point on a famous 25-cent ferry ride, StatenIsland is often derided as ``the world's largest garbage dump.''   Be that as it may, many of the 400,000 residents of New YorkCity's smallest borough want to cut ties with Gotham's government,figuring theirs is by far the better place to live.   Secession? Improbable, say some. Impossible, others argue.Inevitable, say a few die-hards.   A renewed secessionist movement was prompted by a U.S. SupremeCourt ruling in March that declared the city's Board of Estimate _which awards lucrative franchises, contracts and land-developmentprojects _ unconstitutional under the one-person, one-vote rule.   On the board, the borough president of Staten Island carries thesame vote as his Brooklyn counterpart, although Brooklyn'spopulation at 2.2 million is five times as large.   The court ordered New York to create a new form of government,one that will likely eliminate the Board of Estimate and emasculatethe offices of the city's five borough presidents.   Those outside Staten Island, and some who live there, don't taketalk of secession seriously, and as a result, island residents andlocal politicians find themselves the brunt of some more than gentleribbing these days.   Borough President Ralph Lamberti has been referred to at cityhearings on the matter as the ``new George Washington.''   City Councilman Jerome O'Donovan says he's tired of councilcolleagues calling him alderman.   And local secession activist Dan Singletary says he's even beenkidded by his daughter, who lives in Detroit. ``She saw a story in alocal newspaper, called up and said, `Dad, the world's largestgarbage dump wants to secede?'''   To many, Staten Island and garbage are synonymous, thanks to theFresh Kills landfill, a sprawling 2,000 acre, 3-square-mile garbagedump which is already 20 stories high at its tallest point, andgrowing.   ``Yes, we are the largest garbage dump in the world, but maybe wewant to be more than that,'' says Singletary, a transplantedChicagoan and artist who became active in community affairs duringhis 20 years on the island.   To those who live there, Staten Island, with its tree-linedstreets, green hills and wetland and wildlife sanctuaries, is thelast refuge from the concrete and condominiums of the rest of thecity.   Nearly 14 miles long and 7 miles wide, it is 2{ times the size ofManhattan (also an island). Its residents are 90 percent white,middle- and upper-middle class workers, many of whom fled fromdeteriorating Brooklyn neighborhoods after the Verrazano-NarrowsBridge opened in 1964, the only roadway linking Staten Island to therest of the city.   ``We are not Manhattan-style people,'' says Les Trautmann, editorof the daily Staten Island Advance, which has a circulation of about90,000. ``We tend to be more family oriented.''   That small-town feeling is reflected in the newspaper, whichTrautmann says without embarrassment does ``the chicken dinnerstuff,'' lists bridge club results and has a front-page columndevoted to good news.   ``Everyone here talks about going into the city'' as if theyweren't really a part of it, says Trautmann, who describes himselfas a home-grown Staten Islander.   ``Up until a few years ago, we even had people out in Tottenville(an area of the island) who had never been to Manhattan, or anyother part of the city ...It's just a different type of place.''   Most tourists know the borough only as the turnaround point ofthe Staten Island ferry ride, a bargain excursion good for viewinglower Manhattan skyscrapers and the Statue of Liberty.   But if tourists looked beyond the drab and dingy docks, theAmerican Institute of Architects guide says they would find ``hillsas steep as San Francisco's, breathtaking views of New York Harborand Victorian mansions.''   The street where Borough Hall stands looks like Main StreetU.S.A.; its neighbors include a small stationery store, countryfurniture shop, luncheonette and white-steepled church.   Staten Island also has miles of beaches, although many arepolluted; parks and playgrounds galore; 1,000 acres of protectedgreenland; and the city's only historic restoration area.   Still, Staten Island represents only 5 percent of the city'spopulation of 7 million, and New York Harbor serves as a wide moat.   ``We have run into two kinds of people on Staten Island,'' saysSingletary. ``People who feel that the quality of life here haschanged so drastically that they see no reason to stay part of thecity.   ``And a larger group of people who feel New York City is thegreatest city in the world and they don't want to leave unless it isabsolutely necessary. Unfortunately, that may be the case.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JUDY DAUBENMIER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich.

George Romney, the former governor, former Cabinet member andone-time auto executive who made an abortive run for the White Househimself two decades ago, decided he didn't want to fight the crowds.   ``I've been going to inaugurals since Franklin Delano Rooseveltwas inaugurated.

At Romney's urging, Bush announced the three programs during thecampaign.   Romney puts encouraging volunteer work at the top of his list ofaccomplishments.   ``As a result of my experiences, I've concluded that the mostimportant thing I can do is to strengthen the whole volunteer aspectof American life,'' he says.

More important than becoming the first Republican to capture theMichigan governor's chair in 14 years?   Yes, because to Romney government no longer is the solution toAmerica's problems.   ``The most powerful problem-solving force on Earth is theorganized, voluntary cooperation of a free people,'' he says.   Since 1974, Romney has been founding chairman of Volunteer _ theNational Center, an organization based in Arlington, Va., that isdedicated to encouraging volunteerism.   His goal is to create a Volunteer Center in every community thathas a United Way. The centers recruit and place volunteers in localorganizations.   ``I concluded some years ago we had barely tapped theproblem-solving potential of people helping people, as volunteers,''says Romney, who created the nation's first United Way in Detroit in1948. ``I concluded we had organized the money part of volunteeringbetter than we had organized the people part.''   Nearly every week finds Romney on the road somewhere, trying toadd to the 350 Volunteer Centers already established.   On this winter's day, Romney had just returned from an eight-milewalk, a regimen he follows even on Michigan's coldest days. In thesummer, he adds a round of golf at nearby Bloomfield Hills CountryClub to his exercise routine.   ``I don't even have arthritis in my little finger,'' he says.``I've been fortunate, knock on wood.''   His modern, secluded home is on the edge of a private pond thatis stocked with goldfish and fringed with pine trees. In his study,he is surrounded by a wall of books, a signed photograph of formerPresident Gerald Ford, and Time magazine covers bearing his ownpicture.   Romney was born July 8, 1907, in Chihuahua, Mexico, where hisparents and other Mormons had moved to avoid U.S. laws restrictingthe practice of polygamy.   He grew up in Idaho and Salt Lake City, where he met his futurewife, Lenore, while in high school. He was 17 and she was 15. Theywere married seven years later.   Their 57-year marriage has produced four children, 22grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JUDY DAUBENMIER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Feminists are readying a second try atratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, but this time they'llhave to do it without the help of former congresswoman MarthaGriffiths.   It was Griffiths, now Michigan's 77-year-old lieutenant governor,who stalked the halls of Congress to get the 218 signatures neededto pull the ERA out of a House committee and onto the floor fordebate, clearing the way for its eventual overwhelming approval byCongress in 1972.   But the amendment was ratified by only 35 state legislatures,three short of the number needed to add it to the U.S. Constitution.   ``I think part of the problem is that it's also associated withrights for minorities and you'd be surprised how much racism therestill is in this world,'' says Griffiths, a Democrat.   ``Another thing, some men resent tremendously the idea of a womancoming into their offices and really having a chance at promotion.''   Griffiths predicts the amendment will be ratified this century asyoung women become more aware of discrimination.   The next time around, she says, the case for the amendment shouldbe presented in economic terms. ``I never had anybody objecting tomy trying to get more money for their working wives.''   She says women themselves are partially to blame for not beingmore aggressive in seeking promotions and asking for equaltreatment. ``I think a lot of women just won't do it,'' she says.   Griffiths, now in her second four-year term as lieutenantgovernor, never displayed such reluctance when it came to fightingfor women.   Born Martha Wright in Pierce City, Mo., on Jan. 29, 1912,Griffiths is descended from a family that homesteaded in the area.   ``My father thought that girls were as smart as boys and heencouraged me,'' said Griffiths, who grew up going squirrel huntingalongside the boys, out-shooting them because of her steady hands.   She attended the University of Missouri, where she met her futurehusband, Hicks G. Griffiths. They attended the University ofMichigan law school together, graduating in 1940 as theinstitution's first married couple.   After working together for a Detroit insurance company, the twoestablished their own law firm in 1946. They worked on thesuccessful gubernatorial campaign of G. Mennen ``Soapy'' Williams in1948.   Griffiths was elected to the state Legislature and in 1952 ranfor Congress. She lost, but won the seat two years later and becamethe first woman to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee.   ``There is where you find how badly women have been treated,''she says of the tax-writing panel.   One of Griffith's early targets was Social Security, which shesaid required women to pay in as much as men but paid women andtheir children less benefits when they retired or died.   ``What kind of nonsense was that?'' she asks rhetorically.   Griffiths wrestled with the complexities of Social Security andinheritance tax laws, but her greatest achievement involved addingthe word ``sex'' to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.   The effect was to outlaw discrimination against women, blacks andmembers of other racial minorities and create the basis forcountless lawsuits.   Her amendment caught potential opponents flat-footed and itpassed before members of Congress knew what they had done.   ``It was a glorious accident,'' she says. ``It really changedAmerica.''   Feminist leaders revere her.   ``She's a legend in her own time,'' says Marian McCracken, formerpresident of the National Organization for Women and Michigan'srepresentative on NOW's national board.   ``She understood sex discrimination way before her time, waybefore other people did and tried to use her position to dosomething about it,'' says Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund fora Feminist Majority, whose goal is to elect more women to publicoffice.   Griffiths says the push for the ERA changed women's lives eventhough the amendment did not pass.   ``Scores, if not hundreds, of acts were passed at the state,local and federal level, eliminating the worst of thediscriminations,'' she says, adding that ERA opponents thought suchconcessions could blunt the drive for the amendment's passage.   Griffiths surprised the state in 1974 by deciding againstreturning to Congress after her 10th term. She said she had tired ofcommuting after two decades.   She was serving on a number of corporate boards, earning $360,000a year, when then-U.S. Rep. James Blanchard picked her to be hisrunning mate in 1982.   Critics say Griffiths is getting too old to preside over thestate Senate, where she has been known to hush noisy senators duringdebate.   ``Reagan, who just left the presidency, is a year older than I,so what are they really talking about? What they're really talkingabout is a woman. They object to a woman doing anything,'' she says.   ``That's really it. But when you put it to a vote, the peopleaccept me.''   Despite her crusty comments, Griffith has the air of agrandmother with her white hair, wrinkled face, and slow walk. Shehas grandmotherly feelings, too, carrying pictures of hersecretaries' children in her purse and lining her office halls withpaintings of children. Griffiths had no children.   ``I suppose you don't regret what you've never had, but I haveenjoyed other people's children,'' she says.   Despite her age, Griffiths keeps a heavy schedule. Once whenBlanchard's office asked for a list of her engagements since takingoffice, Griffiths' staff needed three days to compile an 80-pagelist containing 900 speeches.   Griffiths hasn't decided whether to remain on the ticket ifBlanchard runs again for governor in 1990.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Moore County Chamber of Commerce hasno office, no telephone. All of its documents reside in one thinfile folder on a closet shelf in Miss Mary Bobo's Boarding House.   Lynne Tolley, the chamber's current president and also theboarding house hostess, shrugs.   ``We don't really go after new industries,'' she says. ``Oh, ifsomebody asks we answer. But we're not looking. Not a bit.''   In chambers of commerce across America, of course, such aviewpoint borders on heresy. But in this corner of the remote androlling foothills of the Cumberland mountains in Middle Tennessee,the consensus seems to be that one industry is sufficient. Whiskey.   Lynchburg, the Moore County seat, is the home of the Jack Danieldistillery.   In warehouses atop the ridge above Jack Daniel's hollow _ orholler as it is pronounced hereabouts _ 47 million gallons ofTennessee sippin' whiskey reside in charred oak barrels, aging. Theripe stuff is bottled daily and new barrels filled.   To the people of Lynchburg and Moore County, that is quite areservoir of security.   There are in America one-industry towns, so-called, where theeconomy relies heavily on a dominant employer. But a researcherwould be hard put to find another place in the nation where thepopulation of an entire county depends for its livelihood, directlyor indirectly, on a single industry, and, as industries go, not avery large one at that. Jack Daniel's work force runs about 350.   ``Ten years ago,'' says Moore County Judge Donald Ray, ``I wouldhave said dependence on the distillery was 100 percent. Now it issomewhat less, but not much. Some people who live in Moore Countynow work in adjoining counties. There are only so many jobs to goaround.   ``But without Jack Daniel's the county would be in a terriblesituation. Every family in Moore County that has been here a longtime has some member or close relative involved with Jack Daniel's,if only as a pensioner.''   Today Moore County _ 131 square miles, all hilly, with apopulation of 4,510, or about 34 souls per square mile _ has onlyone center of commerce, Lynchburg.   The city and county government are one. The county has no doctor,no lawyer, no railroad, no interstate highway, no river, no motel.It has one post office, one state park, one bait shop, oneundertaker, one pool hall and one traffic light, which, according tothe sheriff, is where most accidents happen because people don'tseem to have the hang of having to stop and wait.   Jack Daniel's influence extends far beyond the distillery'sstudiously quaint buildings and stone fences and crystal-clearcreek, beyond its payroll and pensions, even beyond the pint ofwhiskey that goes with every employee's paycheck on the first Fridayof every month, Good Friday as it is known here.   Every cash register in Lynchburg benefits mightily from the300,000 tourists a year the distillery draws, but it doesn't stopthere.   Back in the hills, for example, every farmer relies exclusivelyon the distillery's mash byproduct, called slop, for cattle feed.``The thin soil in these hills won't grow row crops,'' says Ray.``All it will produce is cattle.''   With few exceptions, though, the populace appears more thancontent with its lot, and why not?   Unemployment is lower than any adjacent county and per capitaincome, at $15,928, among the highest in rural Tennessee. Andbecause the distillery has been here through good times and badsince 1866, nobody has the least fear that Jack Daniel's will ever,figuratively speaking, go on the rocks.   Back when Reagor Motlow, the grand-nephew of Jack Daniel himself,was president of the company, his promise was that anyone in MooreCounty who wanted a job could have one at the distillery. He livedup to that. He also said anyone who didn't want a job was welcome toleave the county. There's that, too.   ``There is that,'' says Ray. ``But in all my time in Moore CountyI have never known the distillery to throw its weight around orinterfere in any election or any county decision. Not so much as aspeeding ticket.''   But there is also the experience of 1985. That was long afterReagor Motlow's death and long after he and his three brothers, in1956, sold the company to the huge Brown-Forman distillery inLouisville, Ky. It was the year Jack Daniel's laid off one-fifth ofits work force. The reason given was an increase in federal taxeswhich the company by itself couldn't meet.   There is no evidence that Brown-Forman has interfered in JackDaniel's policies. ``They know better than to kick a pulling mule,''said one longtime employee, Roger Brashears. But for the past fouryears there has existed in Lynchburg an uncommon element ofuncertainty.   And back in the hills, cattle raisers dependent on thathigh-protein slop are uneasy because of a study the company made in1984, just before the layoffs, when it was looking for new revenue.   It showed that a drying process many distillers use to recoverspent mash would allow the company to sell it on the open market fornearly 10 times what it makes distributing the wet product to localfarmers who come by and pick it up themselves.   These are undercurrents in an otherwise tranquil sea.   The company keeps the same low-key image locally as it reflectsin its magazine ads _ just country folks doing unhurried work in a``tiny little town where things don't seem to have changed verymuch.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This remote corner of the Cumberlandhills is not a likely place for major industries to want to locate.And the way Jack Daniel's distillery happened to get here is not aptto be repeated.   Jasper Newton ``Jack'' Daniel was born in 1846, the last of 10children. When he was six his widowed father, hard pressed, sent himoff to live with a neighbor, Dan Call. Call ran a store on LouseCreek and needed an apprentice for his black slave, Nearest Green,who was a superb maker of the store's most prominent product,whiskey.   Dan Call was also a preacher.   When Jack Daniel was 14 a traveling evangelist named Lady Loveborrowed Dan Call's pulpit and told Dan's congregation that theirpastor had better decide whether to preach or make whiskey becausein the eyes of the Lord he couldn't do both.   Jack bought Dan's still, on credit, and went in business.   When the Civil War ended he moved his still a few miles to alovely spring outside Lynchburg, brought with him Nearest Green'sson, George, and prospered.   A new federal law in 1866 required all distilleries to registerwith government tax collectors and Jack Daniel's became the nation'sfirst. It is celebrated as a national historic site as America'soldest registered distillery.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   According to Police Chief Gary Sturm,most of the robbings and thievings and shootings in this town, asin towns large and small across America, are accountable to thedrug trade.   Whoa now, chief. Haven't you heard the song?   Anyone over 35 who owns a radio and has an ear for country musichas to believe that if there is one drug-free zone anywhere in theland it has to be Muskogee, Okla.   Twenty years ago _ has it been that long? _ Merle Haggard, thesongwriter and guitar picker, put Muskogee on the map as a placewhere true Americans lived and had their red, white and blue valueswell in hand.   Muskogee, he sang, during that era of protest, was where nobodysmoked marijuana, burned draft cards or wore hippie sandals.Instead they waved Old Glory, pitched woo and wore manly leatherboots.   Sing along with ol' Merle:   ``I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,   ``A place where even squares can have a ball...''   What went wrong, chief?   ``Well, the song didn't describe Muskogee then or now,'' CarlSturm was saying the other day. Sturm and has lived here all hislife. He was just out of high school when the song was sweeping thecharts and making everybody in town a bit dizzy.   Sturm is indeed proud of his hometown and believes its peopleare as true-blue as any Americans.   But he shakes his head at the irony that Muskogee, of allplaces, would be singled out for the sake of a clever rhyme as thesort of town that might inspire a Norman Rockwell.   ``Of course people smoked marijuana in Muskogee,'' he says.   ``I didn't, but I knew you could buy it in bars and nightclubsaround town. It was sold in matchboxes, $5 a box I believe. Youcould also get amphetamines and barbiturates.   ``But marijuana wasn't grown around here. All that stuff wasimported.   ``I think Merle Haggard understood that Oklahoma has always beenslow about picking up on trends from the East and West coasts. Evensomething as innocent as the price of gasoline. When gas went up to$1.25 in L.A. it was still 80-cents in Muskogee. When it got to$1.25 in Muskogee it was back to 80-cents in L.A.   ``Today they've gotten around to growing some of the bestmarijuana in the United States near here _ now that cocaine is bigeverywhere else.   ``We busted some guys recently with some crack that the LosAngeles police department identified as coming from there. So nowwe have crack here in Muskogee, and it has become a major problem.We're catching guys setting up laboratories out in the backwoods.''   ``Gary's right,'' says Jim East, a boyhood friend of the policechief. ``What we resented was being pictured as behind the times,although we were. We hated that song.''   Jim East graduated in 1972, two years after the town fathers,perhaps sensing a national trend, finally merged the all-blackManual High School with the all-white Central High School into one,Muskogee High School. Jim East now is a reporter in Tulsa.   ``Back then,'' he says, ``the term Okie was a put-down, likehick or redneck. Merle Haggard changed that, I'll say that for him.   ``But at the time, people taunted us with the song. I was on theMuskogee High wrestling team. I remember one out-of-town match thatwound up in a fistfight when the other guys called us Okies fromMuskogee. Sang it at us.   ``When they put the damn song on the cafeteria jukebox we yankedthe cord and shoved the box down a flight of stairs. When we heardthat Merle Haggard was coming to Muskogee for a performance, weplotted to hide in the bed of a pickup and waylay him on Highway69. We didn't, but I didn't go to the performance, either.   ``We were prouder of Muskogee being the one-time stomping groundof Ma Barker and Pretty Boy Floyd and other bad people. That wasits real heritage.''   After 20 years, any bitterness over the song seems to havemellowed.   Now Muskogeeans traveling out of the state smile benignly when adesk clerk says, ``Oh, a real Okie from Muskogee,'' being original.   ``I used to tell people I was from Tulsa,'' says Jim East.   Now Muskogeeans regard The Song as something best forgotten fromlong ago, like a broken Indian treaty. It was, after all, justanother episode in the life of a town that doesn't require a catchycountry parody to define its personality and style.   Was Muskogee really the stomping ground of desperadoes?   ``Yes it was,'' says Chief Sturm, ``and take a look at this.''   He took from a file cabinet a copy of ``Men'' magazine with afeature titled ``Muskogee: Sin Mill of the Southwest.'' The storydetailed wide_open gambling, bootlegging and prostitution.   The edition was dated 1953. That would have been four yearsafter the feds put away Muskogee Sheriff Eddie Briggs, known as thekingpin of Muskogee's bootleggers, and two years after Leslie Scottwas elected constable despite three arrests for running gamblingoperations.   Even during the '60s, Muskogeeans didn't seem to have much truckwith reformers. In 1964 somebody dynamited Police Chief EarlNewton's car. In 1968 somebody shot up Police Chief George Spence'shome. He quit and his successor was chased out of town along withthe city manager and a reform-minded city councilman, whose musicstore was bombed. That was the real Muskogee.   ``Here's another keepsake,'' Sturm says, fetching a device withdice enclosed in a plastic bubble. ``It's called a jiggler.Hundreds of them were made in a garage here in Muskogee. We raidedone place that had a 300-pound magnet under the dice table.Jigglers made sure nobody could switch the dice or even touch them.   ``There's no more regular back-room gambling now, though. Toorisky.   ``Our criminals are more inept, too. Not long ago a couple ofguys lay in wait for a big winner in a poker game, shot him, andgot away with about 20 bucks. They reached in the wrong pocket. Hehad several thousand in the one they didn't turn inside out.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On a wall in the small office of Rudy Rodrigues,a leader of Outward Bound, hangs a detailed map of the wildernesshis charges must conquer in pursuit of survival throughself-confidence.   This challenge is particularly tough. The map is of New York City.   America's large cities are asphalt jungles all right, at least inmetaphor. But for more than a quarter-century in America, OutwardBound has evoked images of well-heeled executives and well-scrubbedyouths in expensive hiking boots breathing clean air on farawaymountains.   So what's a nice program like that doing in a place like this?   ``It's long overdue,'' says Rodrigues, ``or would appear so fromthe results of our first year. This is no experiment. We'recommitted now, and going all out.''   Actually, Rodrigues says, urban Outward Bound programs are areturn to first principles. The organization was founded to teachresourcefulness, confidence, compassion, perseverance andself-esteem, but always has tried to include the ideal of service aswell.   ``It's not easy to stress the service ideal in the wilderness,''he says.   ``The traditional Outward Bound schools cater to the moreprivileged, so this is a shift from the traditional. In the city, weserve. Our focus right now is on inner-city youth and the homeless.''   Serving, Outward Bound crews have renovated shelters, picnickedwith homeless children, distributed food. But, on the theory thatmost urban discord results from people of varied ethnic and economicstripes threatening and fearing one another, relieving socialtensions, Rodrigues feels, might be the best service of all.   Indeed, Outward Bound is so satisfied with its work in concretecanyons that a staff is already setting up a similar program inChicago and others are planned in Boston, Baltimore, Los Angeles andMinneapolis.   A typical New York Outward Bound program matches a dozen or socorporate executives with an equal number of disadvantaged personsof various ages and cultures and turns them all loose on the townfor a few days with an instructor.   The haves live, work and discourse with the have-nots, anunlikely get-together in any town. The haves, moreover, must make dowithout cab fare, credit cards or carpet slippers.   They will sleep outdoors in blankets, walk where they want to goor ride the subway if they have a token. They find meals as bestthey can, and as cheaply.   Without exception, participants report that the experience gavethem a new, less judgmental perception of the lower crust, even abond with them, and thus a clearer view of the city's socialproblems.   For their part, the inner-city folk discarded long-heldprejudices among themselves. ``Black kids and Hispanic kids in NewYork grow up believing that white kids are weak,'' one 18-year-oldblack reported. White participants weren't aware of that.   The corporation picks up the Outward Bound tuition for its ownexecs and also for their classmates, $60 a day each, same fee as thetraditional courses out yonder.   The course relies on proven wilderness techniques transferred tothe cityscape with, of course, some compromises.   Instead of testing endurance by dashing across mountain meadows,for example, the New Yorkers take laps around the Central Parkreservoir. Instead of going hand over hand across a chasm, theyclimb in the rigging of a four-master at the South Street Seaportmuseum. Instead of a white-water raft adventure, they row aneight-oar lifeboat up the East River.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>SLAB FORK, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Curled wood shavings litter the bare dirtunder the awning over the picnic table. The shavings are the residueof whittling, and sweeten the mountain air with an aroma of cedar.   Horseshoe pits are handy. A basketball hoop occupies a nearbyutility pole. Jury-rigged wires from the same pole send juice to amakeshift shack containing a card table, coffee maker, electric fan,icebox. Four Rent-O-Lets are convenient. The sounds are of bird songand a rushing stream, the Slab Fork of Rum Creek.   Are West Virginia's coal miners on a summer outing?   ``Hey, we're in a fight, not on a picnic,'' said Bethel Purkey.``And it's one hell of a fight. But, yeah,'' he said, nodding,``times have changed.   ``We are now doing non-violent civil disobedience. Some of ourbrothers and sisters have a hard time getting hold of that, but it'sworking.   ``This strike is going to be a new beginning for us, or an end _but I don't see an end. I see us winning with this tactic and comingback as strong or stronger than we ever were.''   Purkey is president of Local 5815 of the United Mine Workers ofAmerica.   He is 40, a big man with thick, freckled arms and a bristling redbeard. He admits to having been in his share of brawls, as had hisfather who was a miner, and his grandfather, who died in a cave-in.But Purkey represents a new generation of leadership on the picketline that is putting a new face on the UMW, one of the nation'srowdiest unions.   And he is right. Here in the coal fields of Appalachia, throughtwo months and more of the biggest mine labor dispute in years,times have certainly changed.   Time was, and not long ago, when a West Virginia picket shacksuch as the one at Slab Fork would have been littered not withperfumed cedar shavings but with spent cartridge shells and thesmell of gunpowder.   ``The way they used to stop a truck in the old days,'' Purkeyrecalls, ``was to turn it over and haul the driver out and give hima good thumping. I've seen people shot at, ours and theirs, andpeople thrown in the river, ours and theirs.   ``Now we just stand there and ask the driver to honor our picketline. If he says no we stand there anyhow. Or sit down. The truckshave been turning around.   ``We don't allow any alcohol on the picket line. We don't allowanybody we don't know. We have a captain on every shift, at sixsites, 24 hours a day.   ``Everything is under tight control and discipline. It's working.I don't know how long it will keep working because you can push aman only so far and we have been sorely provoked, but for now it'sworking.''   Purkey and others on the picket line say their new style ofconducting a strike has percolated down from the union president,Richard Trumka, who, they say, has brought them a sense of pride anddignity not felt since the glory days of union founder John L. Lewis.   ``We have a smart man at the head of this organization,'' Purkeysays. ``I have faith in him. All of us do.''   Purkey, along with 350 miners in West Virginia and 1,250 inVirginia, have been on strike since April 5 against the PittstonCoal Group's operations in both states. They went out after working14 months without a contract. Another 300 Kentucky miners joinedthem in June, and that strike touched off sympathy walkoutsinvolving 43,000 miners in 10 states in Appalachia and the Midwest.   Fellow coal miners weren't the only ones, however, drawn to theUMW cause.   ``Your commitment to non-violence and the use of passive civildisobedience has captured the attention of organized labor,'' saidCesar Chavez, the West Coast farm workers' leader, at a recent rallyin Virginia. As long as the miners continue their non-violent ways,Chavez predicted, the public would be on the UMW side.   Public support as well as economic pressure clearly is the UMWstrategy. At that same rally, UMW vice president Cecil Robertsdeclared: ``We've got the whole country on our side now. We arewinning this strike.''   That remains to be seen. A more immediate question facing boththe miners and the coal industry is whether the current wave ofunion support represents a newfound solidarity or the last gasp ofbig labor.   Back in the 1940s, under John L. Lewis, the union could call500,000 members out of the mines and bring the entire industry toits knees. After Lewis retired in 1961, the union began a 20-yeardownhill slide.   Lewis' successor, Tony Boyle, was sent to prison for ordering themurder of a union rival as well as his wife and daughter. Boyle'ssuccessor, Arnold Miller, watched a proliferation of wildcat strikessplinter the union and hamper recruitment in the anthracite fieldsopening in Western states. His successor, Sam Church, lostrank-and-file respect by giving back a number of hard-won benefits,one after a strike of 111 days, another of 72 days.   ``For a long time,'' said Purkey, ``our people didn't really seeanybody up there they had much confidence in until Trumka camealong.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.

If there could be an ideal spot for the birthplace of LittleLeague baseball, you are looking at it.   The Susquehanna River winds down from the green Allegheny hillsthrough a town of 40,000 souls who live in clapboard houses withporch swings and shade trees, a timeless scene off a postcardlabeled ``America.''   An American flag large enough to cover a small infield drawsyour eye to the north bank of the river. It flies proudly in frontof a 45-acre complex of buildings and ball fields, theinternational headquarters of Little League, Inc.   Little League baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary thisyear. Boys who played in the first Little League game, on June 6,1939, have grandchildren playing in the league. A Little Leagueballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities,villages and suburbs across the land.   A three-team league of 30 Williamsport boys in 1939 was theseedbed for what Little League, Inc. today calls the largest sportsorganization in the world. Today, 2.5 million youths play on140,000 teams in 6,000 leagues in the United States and 33 foreigncountries.   ``Of course I had no idea what Little League would become,''says Carl Stotz, who founded the league while working as a clerk ina lumber yard. ``All I envisioned at the time was a neighborhoodprogram. Some of what it has become I am not in favor of.''   At 79, Stotz still lives in Williamsport. He is a man with anincredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and savereceipts.   He can show you, for example, that the total expenses for thefirst Little League season came to $174.63, that the collectiontaken up at the first game netted $1.42, that the first boy-sizedcatcher's mask, ordered from Chicago and which he still has, cost$1.67, the first dozen balls $2. The first year's deficit was$36.72, which Stotz made up out of his own pocket as he did everyyear until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black.   Now Little League, Inc. has assets of more than $10 million anda staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When you drive south on Route 15 innorth-central Pennsylvania, just as you top the crest of Bald EagleMountain pull over and cast your gaze to the valley below.   If there could be an ideal spot for the birthplace of LittleLeague baseball, you are looking at it.   The Susquehanna River, its very name a poem, winds down from thegreen Allegheny hills through a town of 40,000 souls who live inclapboard houses with porch swings and shade trees, a timelessscene off a postcard labeled ``America.''   Move closer. An American flag large enough to cover a smallinfield draws your eye to the north bank of the river. It fliesproudly in front of a 45-acre complex of buildings and ball fields,the international headquarters of Little League, Inc.   Little League baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary thisyear. Boys who played in the first Little League game, on June 6,1939, have grandchildren playing in the league today.   Still, a half-century seems a relatively brief span for anyactivity, however appealing, to attain such astonishing growth andearn such a solid place in the national culture. A Little Leagueballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities,villages and suburbs across the land.   A three-team league of 30 Williamsport boys in 1939 was theseedbed for what Little League, Inc. today calls the largest sportsorganization in the world. Today, 2.5 million youths play on140,000 teams in 6,000 leagues in the United States and 33 foreigncountries. If all the Little Leaguers joined hands the line wouldstretch from the Susquehanna to the Rockies.   ``Of course I had no idea what Little League would become,''says Carl Stotz, who founded the league while working as a clerk ina lumber yard. ``All I envisioned at the time was a neighborhoodprogram. Some of what it has become I am not in favor of.''   At 79, Stotz still lives in Williamsport. He is a man with anincredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and savereceipts.   ``It isn't that I enjoy saving things,'' he once explained tohis daughter who complained about the clutter. ``It's just that Ican't bear to throw anything away.''   He can show you, for example, that the total expenses for thefirst Little League season came to $174.63, that the collectiontaken up at the first game netted $1.42, that the first boy-sizedcatcher's mask, ordered from Chicago and which he still has, cost$1.67, the first dozen balls $2. The first year's deficit was$36.72, which Stotz made up out of his own pocket as he did everyyear until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black.   Now Little League, Inc. has assets of more than $10 million anda staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters. It charges eachof those 140,000 teams a charter fee of $14 each year and earnsmillions on endorsements of athletic equipment and royalties on theLittle League name, which is copyrighted, and the logo, which Stotzdesigned. The business of Little League is unquestionably bigleague.   Stotz's memory of how it all began is vivid.   One August day in 1938 he was playing catch with his twonephews, Jimmy and Harold Gehron, ages 6 and 8, in his back yard at1108 Isabella St. Running backward, he tripped over the jaggedstumps of a cut-down lilac bush and bruised his ankle. His leftankle.   ``I sat on the back steps there,'' he recalls, pointing,``rubbing my ankle.   ``I said to the boys, `How would you like to play on a regularteam with uniforms, a new ball for every game and bats you canreally swing?'   ``One of them said, `Uncle Tuck' _ that's what they called me _`who would we play?'   ``I decided on the spot it would have to be a league of teams.''   Stotz gathered up a group of neighborhood boys each evening andwent to a flat field at Memorial Park where picknickers playedsoftball.   ``I used folded newspapers for bases, threw the ball to variouspositions and had the boys run the bases. We tried differentdistances between the bases until I found what I thought would beright for them, and paced it off. It came close enough to 60 feetthat I rounded it off to that.''   Through the winter Stotz worked out the details, rules, agelimits and the like, which have remained essentially unchanged. Hecalled on 57 merchants before he found the first sponsor, LycomingDairy.   The next spring Little League was born.   ``When Carl passed out the uniforms, the day before the firstgame, it was one of the proudest days of my life,'' recalls BillBair.   ``It meant it was really going to happen. Some of the guys putthem on right there on the field. Maurice Reader wore his to bedthat night.''   Bair, who now lives in nearby Montoursville, hit .462 that yearto become Little League's first batting champion.   When Korea won the Little League World Series 1984, you cancredit Bill Bair in part. Bair and other Little League graduates inthe armed services spread Little League all across the Far East.Bair's son, Craig, now manages a Little League team in Thailand.   Stotz recalls that late in June of the first year some fansberated the umpire until he walked off the field.   ``It was the first indication,'' said Stotz, ``of the problemsoverzealous fans can cause.''   Frank Rizzo began as a Little League umpire in 1941 and, at 78,is still at it, conducting the Little League's umpiring school inWilliamsport.   ``I've seen some ugly things when the parents get too excited,''he says. ``The kids walk off the field arm-in-arm, but I know ofmothers who would't speak to each other for a month.''   It gets worse than that.   When an umpire named Charles Berryhill called a game inWaynesburg, Pa., on account of darkness, an irate mother hit himover the head with an umbrella.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULES LOH</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>WILLOW CREEK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The remains of the airplane layrotting in the slimy thicket of a gulch, wings clipped, tail shorn,body stove in, a sorry looking carcass guarded by squadrons ofbloodthirsty mosquitoes.   To Ted Spencer it shone like a jewel.   ``It can be restored,'' Spencer was saying, stalking theremains, nodding. ``Yes, it can.'' His boots made sucking sounds ashe bounded around in the muck snapping pictures, oblivious to themosquitoes, his glee obvious.   ``I heard about this airplane last year and didn't believe itwas true. When I came and saw it for myself, saw `Ptarmigan II'painted on its nose, my heart leapt. Look, you can still read it.''   Ted Spencer is the director of the Alaska Aviation HeritageMuseum which occupies a corner of the Anchorage airport.   At 42, he couples a childlike exuberance for airplanes with aprofessorial knowledge of them, especially airplanes of thePtarmigan II vintage.   His aim is to document, through records and artifacts, one ofthe most colorful periods in American history, the 20 years beforeWorld War II when ``The Aviation,'' as it was called, came toAlaska.   The old airplanes themselves, of course, are the primeartifacts. A proud array of them, restored to look like new,contrast handsomely with their modern counterparts flying overhead.   ``What those aviation pioneers did in Alaska was no lessextraordinary,'' says Spencer, ``than men landing on the moon. Whatthey accomplished had immediate effects, and they were moresignificant in Alaska than the advent of aviation in any otherstate. They liberated America's last frontier.''   Flying out to Willow Creek recently _ there being no other wayto cover the 275 miles from Anchorage _ Spencer pointed out thewindow to a beach on the Kuskokwim River near the village ofMcGrath. As if to document his own claim, he scribbled a note tohis fellow passenger:   ``Carl Ben Eielson flew first airmail to that spot Feb. 1924.Single-engine DeHavilland DH-4. Open cockpit. Came from Fairbanks.Three-hour flight in winter.''   Before Eielson's flight it took 20 days to make that 300-milemail run by dog team. You can see a photograph of Eielson and hisairplane at the Heritage Museum.   More out of continuing necessity than nostalgia for those glorydays of epic feats, Alaska has remained by far the flyingest statein the nation.   According to Federal Aviation Administration figures, Alaska,per capita, has eight times as many pilots and 15 times as manyplanes as the U.S. average. It works out to one pilot for every 55Alaskans and one plane for every 57. Alaska's 9,682 licensed pilotsaverage 132 flying hours a year compared with a national average,including Alaska, of 49 hours.   Hood Lake in Anchorage is the world's largest seaplane base.Merrill Field, which handles only general aviation _ light planesfor personal and charter use _ is busier than the internationalairports in Seattle-Tacoma, Salt Lake City, and Orlando, Fla.   ``It's hard for people who haven't experienced Alaska tovisualize its vastness and its terrain,'' said the FAA's PaulSteuke.   ``We have only about 533,000 people, most of them scattered insettlements that would be utterly isolated without the airplane.Our few roads, very few, are like streams without tributaries, youcan't get to them. Even if you could, they're often impassable inwinter.   ``Add to that four huge mountain ranges and unpredictableweather systems boiling out of the Pacific. Even skilled pilotshave to stay on their toes in Alaska.''   How much more so, says Spencer, for the aviation pioneers whoestablished that almost mythic breed known as bush pilots. Duringthe 1920s and 1930s they became the most popular and honored men inAlaska.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULIA RUBIN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CRESTONE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hanne Strong unrolls her blueprint of a``global village'' for spiritual leaders and environmentalists andpins its corners down on her kitchen table with an expensive teaset.   It shows a band of temples and churches, gardens, and small,self-sufficient communities laid out along the foot of the Sangrede Cristo mountains here.   Some of what's in the plan already has been realized, some is inthe works, and some exists just in ``prophecy,'' Strong says.   Like Strong, who travels the area's back roads in skirts andsilk blouses as comfortably as in jeans, the plan is at once earthyand elegant, serious and a little spacey, embracing thedisadvantaged one minute and industrial magnates and movie starsthe next.   ``Unenlightened, confused minds are ruling the world anddestroying the environment,'' Strong says. ``There needs to be amajor shift in the way people think.''   Strong and her husband, Canadian oil developer and UnitedNations diplomat Maurice Strong, hope to turn several thousandacres of desert and mountains in southern Colorado's San LuisValley into a repository of spiritual truth and environmentallysound living _ a place where political and business leaders cancome to be taught how to care for themselves and the Earth.   They don't want a lot of people, who would tax the area'sfragile natural balance.   The place, originally part of the 160,000-acre Baca Spanishland-grant ranch, is called just ``the Baca.'' Area Indiansbelieved it to be sacred, ``neutral'' ground where tribes couldcome together. Hanne Strong believes it has kept that power intact.   The Strongs already have given away hundreds of acres toCarmelite Catholics, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Zen monks, AmericanIndian tribes and the yoga-based Sri Aurobindo Learning Center.They have put up chapels, hermitages, temples, sweat lodges,community buildings and gardens.   On the blueprint, Hanne has set aside 2,000 more choice acresfor other religious groups she believes will come to the Bacasomeday as earlier groups did _ on their own. She does not recruit.   A native of Denmark who personally feels closest to the AmericanIndian spiritual tradition, Strong says she respects allspirituality but intends the Baca to be for religions with ``anunbroken lineage,'' not the so-called ``New Age'' groups.   ``This is `Old Age,''' she says with a laugh. ``Very old.''   The Strongs have sold land at the Baca to less-establishedspiritual groups, although not yet to actress Shirley MacLaine, afriend of Strong's who visits the Baca often and wants to set up aspiritual community here.   One such group that bought land at the Baca is the HaidakhandiAshram, which is building a Vedic temple and small community on 46acres to follow the teachings of Haidakhan Babaji, a Hindu mystic.   Other projects under way include an Experimental Garden and SeedBank for high-altitude crops, an educational center for AmericanIndian youth, a world nutritional center and various healingcenters.   Scattered among the spiritual groups and projects are about 100homes, the beginnings of the Baca Grande retirement community thatwas cut short when the Strongs came to the area in 1979.   Most of the Baca development remains a virtual wilderness, wherea visitor sees more deer than people, and signs of mountain lionand bear.   ``It's a complete ecosystem,'' Strong says. ``It's still in apure state.''   The Baca, elevation 7,800 feet, can only be reached from thewest. To the east rises a wall of craggy, snow-covered peaks risingto more than 14,000 feet, the Sangre de Cristos.   Compared to the arid valley a traveler crosses to get here, muchof the Baca is lush, traversed by creeks and shaded by tall trees.   Some of the spiritual groups that have moved here actually weredirected to the Baca by Hopi Indian elders. Cree, Blackfoot, Uteand Sioux tribes have built ceremonial lodges at the Baca, andNavajos and Hopis make pilgrimages here.   ``This is a sacred place, for hundreds, thousands of years,''says Mike Sierra, a Lakota Sioux from the Pine Ridge reservation inSouth Dakota, who travels to the Baca occasionally as an apprenticeto a Sioux medicine man. ``It's a place of power.''   The area's beauty inspires all the spiritual groups that havesettled here.   ``The desert and the mountains are deep religious symbols forevery spiritual community, and right at the heart of the Carmelitephilosophy,'' says Sister Sharon Doyle at the Carmelite monastery,where the buildings blend into the landscape and are invisible froma distance. ``Aesthetics are very important to us for creating acontemplative climate...Beauty uplifts the soul. It's part of thewhole consciousness of this area _ respect or reverence for theEarth.''   The Carmelites, who moved to the Baca from Sedona, Ariz., in1983 because of encroaching development, have 104 acres, includinga mountain hermitage. Nine full-time hermits _ both men and women _live at the Baca, and their numbers are growing. The order isnegotiating to buy more property and has a waiting list ofretreatants.   The Baca is bordered on the north by Crestone, a tinygold-mining town gone bust, and on the south by the Great SandDunes National Monument. To the west is the Baca Grant Ranch, withmore than 4,500 head of cattle. Maurice Strong is the ranch's boardchairman.   Crestone is an hour from the nearest supermarket, in Alamosa,and half a day's drive from Denver, northeast over a couple ofmountain ranges.   Crestone's post office was about to close in the early 1970swhen the subdivision came along, followed several years later bythe Strongs. Now about 200 people live in the town and adjoiningdevelopment year-round, 300 in the summer.   Residents include ranch hands and a handful of old-timers aswell as retirees and those attracted either by the spiritual groupsor by the chance to live in a small town with an internationalflavor.   The tiny Crestone phone book is riddled with such entries as``Crystal Sojourns'' and ``Ahimsa Lifestyle.''   It also includes some of the rich and famous the Strongs havebrought to the area, including Robert O. Anderson, former chairmanof Atlantic Richfield, and Najeeb E. Halaby, former head of PanAmerican Airlines and father of the queen of Jordan.	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULIA RUBIN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CRESTONE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hanne and Maurice Strong come off afaster, more international track than just about anyone in Crestone.   Maurice's early years sound like a Jack London story. Born inManitoba in 1929, he ran away at 13, after graduating from highschool five years early. He stowed away on a ship to Alaska where,at 17, he became an apprentice fur trader.   He soon started his own mining company and his businessinterests proliferated. By age 23, he had made his first $1 million.   Strong was the first head of the Canadian InternationalDevelopment Agency, from 1966-70, and the first head of PetroCanada, from 1976-78.   But he soon began augmenting his business expertise withenvironmental experience, and served as executive director of theUnited Nations environmental program, based in Nairobi, in themid-1970s. In 1985, he was named executive coordinator of theUnited Nations' African emergency relief operations.   An unusual mix of capitalist-developer and, as The New YorkTimes called him in 1975, ``Custodian of the Planet,'' Maurice saysit is important to forge links between business andenvironmentalism.   ``I believe you have to be in the middle of these things,'' hesays. ``In our system, the market system, you affect theenvironment, and the only way to affect the environment positivelyis to make sure that you have environmental considerations builtright into your business.''   When Maurice Strong first came to the Baca in 1978 afteracquiring an interest in AZL Resources, which owned it, he says heknew he wanted to save it from routine development.   ``We were attracted by the qualities that make it so special now_ the beauty, the space, the fact that it's not a ski resort,'' hesays.   Strong does want to develop the area's water, however, and heand a group of investors currently are embroiled in a heateddispute with valley water users over the investors' claim on whatthey say is a huge, untapped aquifer.   Valley residents are skeptical of Strong's claim that the valleywould benefit if his company sold the water to outside cities.   Hanne Strong's interests stick closer to the Baca, and she saysshe and Maurice complement each other.   ``I'm the mystical one,'' she says. ``He's the manifester. Hegets things done.''   She was born Hanne Marstrand in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1941.Her father ran a fleet of salmon ships, and both her parents wereactive in the resistance to the Nazis, she says.   Born a Lutheran but raised Catholic, Hanne says she had mysticalexperiences early on, including seeing angels.   ``I knew from a very young age that I wasn't Danish, that I wasIndian,'' she says. ``And I knew that one day I would be with mypeople.''   After studying industrial and interior design in Denmark, shemoved to New York City in her early 20s and set up a design firm.   In 1972, Hanne left her business and moved to Nairobi where shehad been hired to design the country's United Nations headquarters.There she met Maurice Strong.   The couple moved to Calgary, Alberta, in 1972, where Hannebecame involved in Indian political issues.   When she first came to the Baca, she says, ``I knew I was home.''   Hanne believes she and the Baca are creatures of both luck anddestiny.   ``I like luck _ I feel I've got a lot of it,'' she says. ``Butfar greater forces are at work and I know it will happen. It wasmeant to be. We're just tools, and we have to perfect ourselves.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULIA RUBIN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Less than a year ago, Pete Shields had $5 to hisname, a drinking problem and nothing but the sky to sleep under. Hehad spent 20 years living on the street.   Shields, 46, now has more than $400 in the bank, an apartmentand a 40-hour-a-week job, and not just at the minimum wage.   ``I don't figure I've done too bad,'' he was saying the otherday as he took a breather from his work at Osage Resource RecoveryInc., which hires only homeless or indigent people.   The company, which handles promotional mailings, is owned byOsage Initiatives, a combination of public and private concernsthat was created just under a year ago as a new approach to solvingthe problem of the homeless.   Osage has placed about 90 homeless people in jobs withDenver-area businesses and has created about 25 jobs through itsown business ventures, such as ORRI, which hired Shields.   ORRI is Osage's first wholly owned business, but it also workswith companies in ``allied ventures'' to provide other jobs. Suchventures include the maintenance company Artisan Initiatives,Dominion Services asbestos removal company, and a cafeteria onOsage's premises that trains the homeless for work in the foodservice industry.   Osage also houses five community agencies offering job trainingand counseling and a day care center.   ORRI pays its employees a minimum of $4.50 an hour, plusbenefits, and says it has been competitive because of low overheadcosts. Osage's complex of renovated buildings lies along therailroad tracks just west of downtown Denver.   ``It demonstrates that you can have a social conscience and be acapitalist all at once,'' says Marcia Malone, head of businessdevelopment at Osage. She says many firms have responded favorablyto doing business with the company.   ``Businesses like what we're doing because we're doing itwithout federal funds.''   Osage director Earl Belofsky says more than 60 percent ofDenver's homeless mainly need jobs.   ``We're saying, `Don't give us money, give us the contracts andthe jobs,''' he says. ``If we can catch them before they fallthrough the cracks, they haven't lost their self-esteem. Most of usaren't very far from that line.''   Most of the people Osage hires or places come out of shelters,which screen them to make sure they are willing and able to work.   Each night there are between 2,100 and 2,600 homeless people inDenver, according to a census the Colorado Coalition for theHomeless conducted about a year ago.   Shields is one of about a dozen men working in ORRI's renovatedwarehouse, filling an order from a local brewery. They are puttinggift items into kits for a promotional mailing.   ``I was just one of those people who didn't want to settledown,'' says Shields, who was married three times but ``drank myway through all my marriages.''   ``One day I just decided I'm about that age where I should dosomething and not thrash around on the street,'' he says.   Shields joined an alcohol treatment program and was directed toOsage for a job. He had some construction experience, he says, andwould like to get back to that eventually.   ``Here, I can make my way up the ladder if I use my head,'' hesays. ``I'd like to get back into construction. I have skills. I'vegot the brain to do it if I just put my mind to it.''   Also working in the warehouse is John Velasquez. In the twomonths he has been working there, Velasquez and his wife and theirfour young children have been able to move out of a shelter.   Velasquez had lost his job as a machine adjuster and ended up injail for failing to appear in court on drunken driving charges.When he decided to sober up, he couldn't get hired again.   ``I had gone to electrical and mechanical school and I know I'vegot some talents here,'' he says. ``I knocked on a lot of doors,even tried dishwashing.''   Velasquez says Osage is teaching him new job skills.   ``They opened doors for hope _ I'm so grateful,'' he says.``When you make a mistake, it hits so hard.''   The idea for Osage developed after Jack MacAllister, the chiefexecutive office of U S West, the telephone company, visited aDenver shelter for the homeless. MacAllister was struck by thesight of a man meticulously ironing a pair of pants for a jobinterview.   Soon after, he contacted the five agencies and worked toestablish Osage. U S West donated the buildings and, along withother community businesses, provided a $2.8 million loan to helprenovate them. U S West also provided $300,000 in seed money forbusiness development, and gave ORRI some of its first contracts _fixing parts of phone booths.   Belofsky says Osage will pay back the loans.   Malone says ORRI made its first sale in June and had sales of$66,000 in the next six months. Then in January alone it took in$70,000. Malone says she is optimistic that ORRI can gross at least10 times that much this year.   ``Our product is as good as anybody's,'' Belofsky says, notingthat ORRI is set up to handle big promotional mailings and similarprojects that most companies are not set up to handle in-house.   Belofsky says the Adolph Coors Co., for instance, placed itsfirst order with Osage for $1,800. Its second was for $42,000.   Belofsky says companies in other cities have contacted him foradvice in starting up ventures similar to Osage.   ``We're in business to create jobs,'' he says. ``We have to makemoney so we can keep doing that.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By JULIA RUBIN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Paul Meyer, an 81-year-old former correctionsoffice and bank guard who drives a dented pickup truck, collectshundreds of pounds of newspapers a day for recycling. He gives theproceeds to charity.   Like a growing number of others, Meyer has found there's moneyto be made in trash. He figures he's given more than $60,000 tovarious Masons' organizations since 1977, in particular theScottish Rite Foundation for Aphasic Children, which he helpedestablish.   Meyer takes his newspapers to Tri-R Systems, a recycling companyin northeast Denver, which like many other companies is cashing inon the recycling boom.   Meyer's stack of newspapers is immediately added to theinventory by laptop computer.   ``We've essentially applied fast-food techniques to the oldscrap business,'' says Tri-R president David Powelson.   The scrap and recycling industry is approaching the $14 billionmark in annual sales, Powelson says. He said Tri-R had $1.5 millionin sales in 1983 and $5.3 million in sales last year.   Founded in 1977, it now accepts 35 kinds of recyclablematerials, from paper to plastic and brass to glass, at operationsin three states.   The growth of recycling has ``changed the economies of scale''in the scrap industry, attracting entrepreneurs versed inbusiness-school economics and computer technology, Powelson says.   Bob Rubin agrees. He's director of Recycle Now, a non-profitgroup funded largely by the beverage and container industries toencourage the growth of recycling in Colorado.   ``There's a definite trend toward multimaterial recyclingfacilities with an emphasis on being as convenient as possible,''he says. ``Recycling works best when it's most convenient.''   Although America still has one of the lowest recycling rates ofindustrialized nations _ about 10 percent _ that rate has begun toclimb in the last few years and is expected to accelerate in thenext decade.   The nation's garbage dumps are filling up rapidly, and publicawareness of the problem has grown to what Powelson calls``staggering'' proportions.   Studies say as much as 86 percent of household trash could berecycled, and the Environmental Protection Agency has set a goal ofrecycling 25 percent within four years.   Smaller scrap and recycling companies also are benefiting fromthe industry boom.   Leonard Benson, of Benson and Benson Iron and Metal Co., sayshis company is expanding, moving from its scrap yard in Denver to a``customer-service center'' in suburban Westminster equipped withcan-buying machines and attendants to help customers unload theirrecyclables.   Benson, whose father was in the scrap business, says he didn'tdecide to enter the business until five years ago.   ``Recycling has put a lot of people into business,'' he says,adding that scrap dealers ``are getting away from the old scrapsalvage yard.''   ``We're now dealing with residential businesses and people inthe community _ providing a community service by making recyclingefficient to more customers.''   For manufacturers, using recyclables can be cheaper than findingand processing raw materials. Using recycled paper products insteadof virgin products, for example, can cut the energy used inproduction by as much as 74 percent, according to the Washington,D.C.-based Worldwatch Institute. It also cuts water usage by morethan half, and air and water pollution significantly.   Tri-R has more than 1,000 commercial accounts to which it sendstrucks to pick up recyclables. It also collects recyclables frompeople who come to its several distribution centers in Colorado,Wyoming and Arizona, or to the dozen or so ``Money Mobile''truck-trailers that the company franchises out and parks on busystreets in residential neighborhoods.   Tri-R turns around and sells the recyclables to companies likeContainer Corporation of America, Weyerhaeuser, Reynolds Aluminumand others, including brokers who sell the recyclables to mills inseveral Asian countries.   Old computer paper that Tri-R picks up at a corporate customer'soffices, for instance, is put on conveyor belts in Tri-R'swarehouse and run through a shredder and baler.   The shredded spread sheets are bought by tissue-papermanufacturers, Powelson says.   The company's main warehouse in Denver processes 4 million to 5million pounds of recyclable materials daily, most of which is soldthe very same day to keep inventory low.   Computerization of the inventory means Tri-R also can adjust theprices it pays for materials to fit the latest market conditions,Powelson says.   Powelson says the recyclers' real competition is the trash can,and he is hopeful ``the world's No. 1 throw-away society'' willkeep changing its ways.   Standing amid mountains of baled paper and cans in Tri-R'swarehouse, he winces at the words ``trash'' or ``garbage.''   ``I just look at them and see money,'' he says.   So does Meyer. One load of newspapers in his truck weighs from2,200 to 2,800 pounds, for which he is paid 1{ cents a pound.   When asked how much he makes in this business, Meyer consults abattered notebook he keeps in his shirt pocket. In the last 2{months, he brought in about 40 tons of paper for $1,750.75.	</TEXT><NOTE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vartan Gregorian is an ebullient Armenianwho rejuvenated the New York Public Library in a flurry of fundraising. Brown University is a 224-year-old Ivy League institutionwith dwindling donations and an iconoclastic curriculum.   Brown, with an enrollment of 7,000, has a $370 million endowment,the lowest among Ivy League colleges. Massachusett's HarvardUniversity, by comparison, has a $3 billion endowment.   Gregorian, who will be inaugurated as Brown's 16th president onApril 9, is a curly-haired, round-faced workaholic who rescued theNew York library from a financial crisis by raising nearly $500million in his seven years there.   ``I've always favored the underdog,'' says Gregorian, 54. ``Brownhas always had to do more with less.''   Gregorian, who took over the duties of former president Howard R.Swearer on Jan. 1, has 22 years experience as a teacher and as aprovost at the University of Pennsylvania. But he acknowledges thathis fund-raising ability ``was not held against him.''   Brown, now in the final year of a three-year fund-raising drive,saw gifts drop from $51.3 million in 1986-87 to $35.1 million in1987-88, according to Samuel Babbit, vice president for development.   While he may become involved in fund-raising, Gregorian says his``primary obligation will be to the academic welfare of theinstitution.''   ``It's the educational challenge that has brought me here,'' hesays.   Brown was one of the first major colleges in the turbulent 1960sto do away with most general requirements. Today, it's one of thelast to resist returning to the more traditional program of corecourses.   Gregorian, who holds a doctorate in history and humanities fromStanford University, is concerned with the over-specialization amongstudents at many colleges.   He wants college not only to ``give students training, but togive them an education; not just an education but to instill themwith culture _ with breadth of scope, so they can adapt in thesedifficult times to a fast-changing world.''   ``Curriculum is not a frozen document,'' Gregorian says. He plansto study records for the full 19 years of the ``new'' curriculumbefore deciding if he will change its direction.   ``Brown's success is the flexibility of its curriculum as itenables students to respond to their needs,'' he says. ``Thisone-dimensional or narrow professionalism reduces people'sintellectual curiosity and brings a narrow range.   ``We must teach people how to cope, not with success alone, butwith adversity and failure. Out of failure and adversity there is alot you learn.''   Gregorian knows of both. He left the University of Pennsylvaniafor the library in 1981 after being passed over for the university'spresidency.   A native of Iran who was educated in Beirut, he says he missedacademia during his time in New York.   ``One of the things I missed in the years at the library, Ididn't have time to read or write,'' says Gregorian, the author ofthree books. ``One of the tragedies is to sit on the mountain ofknowledge and not have time to get to it.''   Gregorian, who plans to teach a freshman course so he can set``an example that teaching and leadership are not mutuallyexclusive,'' says his first priority will be faculty recruitment,nationally and internationally.   ``Two-thirds of the American professors will be retiring in thenext 10 years,'' he says.   While Gregorian will focus on the faculty, his reputation is withthe students.   A faculty adviser to two dormitories at Penn, he often dined withthe students. He says he hopes to continue that practice at Brown.   ``I'll be getting to know the students, whether they'd like toknow me...,'' he jokes.   Officials on the Brown search committee, which chose Gregorianamong 200 applicants, looked for a scholar-educator, according tocommittee head Martha Nussbaum, a philosophy professor.   ``We wanted to find someone who had experience doing research anda high level of excellence _ and it wouldn't hurt if they could alsoraise money and walk on water,'' she says.	</TEXT><NOTE>By KAY BARTLETT</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert B. Cialdini wrote his book about sleazysales techniques to warn consumers to be on guard. Now he'sfrequently invited to speak to the people in charge of the selling.   The 43-year-old professor of psychology at Arizona StateUniversity in Tempe spent three years researching his book,``Influence: The New Psychology of Modern Persuasion.'' He became aused-car salesman, peddled products door-to-door, sold advertising,made ``cold calls'' on the telephone, learning all the salespitches.   Now he's on the lecture tour, taking his message to marketingand sales executives, negotiators, attorneys, fund-raisers and thelike.   ``The people who invited me to come for lectures alreadyunderstood the process in an inarticulated way,'' he says. ``Thatis, they knew what worked, but they wanted to know why it worked.They wanted the psychological underpinnings.''   Thus Cialdini began speaking more about the ethics of thepersuasion process than the process itself. He says he has anatural interest in the subject since he describes himself as atypical patsy for a sales pitch.   But he says he's not alone. He maintains that we are socializedin such a way that if someone gives us something for free, such asa Hare Krishna flower at an airport, we feel we must reciprocate insome way. Or, we are taught not to interrupt, so we subjectourselves to a long telephone pitch because we are too polite tojust hang up.   Cialdini's research shows how the salesmen capitalize on thesecivilities without the consumer being aware.   In his own research, he found a fire safety sales pitch amongthe seamiest. The salesman would come in for a free inspection of ahome and the lucky homeowner would receive a free fire extinguisher.   ``First, the salesman would show pictures of burned children,''he says. ``It was just awful.''   After the inspection, he would ask the homeowners to fill out aquestionnaire while he went out to the car to get something.   ``He would always say, `Stay seated. I'll let myself out andcome back in.' That's very important. Think of it. Who do you letin and out of your house? Someone you trust. So the salesman hasestablished himself as a trusted person by this simple technique.''   Then came the pitch. It went something like, ``Charles, do youthink your wife and litte girl here are worth $2,000?'' What otherway can you answer that?   If the potential customer was still resistant, the salesmanwould ask permission to call his office and report he had failed atanother sale, a failure he explains that might cost him his job.But then the front office, all part of the central plot, wouldexplain that he could offer them the products for $500 less sincehis job was on the line.   Cialdini also took breathing lessons so he could make a pitch onthe telephone without taking a breath, thus not allowing the otherparty to interject, ``I'm not interested.''   He regrets that consumer groups showed a lack of interest in hisbook, but he says the interest of corporate America changed hislife.   ``IBM flew me to Monte Carlo for a month _ twice _ for bigeducational conferences,'' he says. ``That's the kind of boondoggleI always read about somebody else getting. But I got it and theypaid me money besides.''   He gets $3,500 per lecture, or $5,000 for half a day, but he'shad to cut his speaking down to twice a month. He's back teachingpsychology after a sabbatical.   Cialdini says he's pleased that the book did not turn him into a``pop psychologist'' and that he did not lose academic standingbecause of it.   The book, published in 1984 and re-issued as an academic text in1988, outlines the six ``triggers'' people respond to indecision-making: authority, reciprocity, scarcity, commitment,consensus and liking.   In discussing the authority technique, Cialdini offers anethical and unethical use.   If nine out of 10 doctors really did prefer a certain brand,that's one thing, he says. But it's something else to have an actorwhom the public identifies with the physician he portrays endorsinga decaffeinated coffee.   Cialdini describes the difference as the ``detective'' approachand the ``smuggler'' approach. The detective approach is to findnaturally hidden triggers in the product. The smuggler approach isto create them, such as the actor in a white doctor's coatendorsing a product.   Let's say you have spent about half an hour with a used-carsalesman. Do you feel as though you like him? If the answer is yes,watch out. You are being manipulated. The question is whether theprice on the car is a good deal.   That technique explains the success of such products asTupperware, Avon, and Mary Kay, he says. The seller of thoseproducts is likely to be a friend, or at least an acquaintance.   Let's say you are looking at a house to buy and your real estateagent becomes aware that another family is also interested. Hetells you that someone else might get it. That is perfectlylegitimate. He's acting in your best interest. However, in anunethical scenario, there is no other buyer out there, but theagent creates one to get you to put down a firm bid.   How do you know when it's real?   Unfortunately, often, you don't.   ``That's why all salesmen tend to get tarred with the same brushand end up ranking down there below undertakers,'' Cialdini says.   ``When I talk to business groups, the point I make is that theyare going to do better in the long term by being ethical,'' hesays. ``Then they sit up and take notice.''   He uses as an example a trusted mechanic who told him therepairs necessary on his car would be $45. The previous mechanichad estimated $500.   ``He was very ethical and he now has me as a customer forlife,'' Cialdini says.   Although he's back teaching now, Cialdini says that the researchhe put in on his book gave him one more advantage.   ``I can say no a lot better now.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By KAY BARTLETT</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Quick, what's the difference between 1million, 1 billion and 1 trillion?   You're in trouble if you respond with something like, ``What'sthe difference when the figures get that high?''   If you think the Empire State Building is about a mile high,plead guilty again.   You're an innumerate.   Help, however, is at hand.   Meet the oxymoronic John Allen Paulos, a witty mathematicsprofessor who quotes philosophers, devours novels, once did astand-up comedy act in a Philadelphia club and passionately hopeshis fifth-grade math teacher reads his latest book. He's also a manwho doesn't think the world would be a better place if we were allable to work quadratic equations.   ``Come to the fifth floor,'' he instructs a visitor, ``and go toroom...this is rather embarrassing given the subject of the book,but it's either room 540 or 542.''   A huge poster of Bertrand Russell, one of his idols, looks overhis shoulder as he works. A pyramid of blue and magenta emptyHawaiian Punch cans _fun to move around in different configurations_ rests quietly now in a garish display on his windowsill.   Paulos, a 43-year-old Temple University professor, has written``Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences,'' a bookwhose title would not compel the average reader to snap it off theshelf. But it's fun, and Paulos tells you it's OK to skip the toughparts.   One of the tough parts is the title itself. The word``innumeracy,'' which means the inability to deal comfortably withthe fundamental notions of number and chance, has been in usage inEngland since the 1950s, Paulos says. He first came across itseveral years ago in an article in Scientific American.   ``It will be in American dictionaries soon,'' he says. ``DanRather has used it a few times and that's got to be an imprimatur.''   But back to that first question. Throughout the book, Paulos hasa knack of breaking things down into easily grasped units.   He wants people to have a sense of the vast difference among themembers of the ``...illion'' family. He suggests you look at it thisway: One million seconds takes about 11{ days to tick by. A billionseconds would take almost 32 years. A trillion seconds equals 32,000years.   Paulos says he sometimes asks his freshman students how high theEmpire State Building is.   ``I don't want them to go and look it up,'' he says. ``I justwant to know about their sense of proportion and scale. I wouldconsider 1,000 feet a correct answer, even 2,000 feet, because it'sin the range. (Actual footage is 1,200 feet.) But if a student said50 feet or a mile, he has no sense of what a mile is, what a mile islike straight up in the air.''   Paulos, who teaches freshmen as well as graduate students, is arecognized expert in symbolic logic, computer languages andartificial intelligence. Born in Denver, he grew up in Milwaukee anddescribes himself as a bright kid but very shy.   ``This is a book for educated people,'' he says.   Paulos notes that he once accompanied his wife, a former Frenchteacher turned romance novelist, to the doctor to learn more about aminor procedure she was facing.   ``Within 20 minutes, the doctor said there was only amillion-to-one shot of something going wrong, that it was a 99percent safe procedure, and then he said that it usually went quitewell,'' he says. When Paulos tried to explain to the physician thathe just said three entirely different things, he was met with a grimstare and incomprehension.   ``Even in their areas of expertise, people just use numbers, notknowing what they mean,'' he says.   Paulos has met with blank stares before. When he did the comedyclub act one of his jokes had to do with the sign suggestingcitizens put litter where it belongs. Paulos pointed out that ifpeople did that, it would no longer be litter, it would be garbage.Litter, he pointed out, is litter only when it is littering.   Not too many chuckles.   ``Actually, most of it went quite well, but some of it was alittle too cerebral for the club,'' he says.   He also gets blank stares when he quips that something selling ata ``fraction of its normal cost'' probably is _ and that thefraction is 4@3.   His quixotic quest is serious. He feels that innumeracycontributes to a lack of skepticism and lack of critical thinking,which leads to poor life decisions.	</TEXT><NOTE>By KAY BARTLETT</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A vegetarian lunch is served every day byThe People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.   PETA, as it is called, likes to describe itself as a grass-rootsorganization. It does have access to a large network of people itcan mobilize for a specific cause.   However, it is also a centralized operation with computers,direct mail solicitation, an aerobics class at 6 p.m. and a parkinglot filled with ``Meat is Dead'' and ``Liberate Lab Animals'' bumperstickers.   It says its average contribution from its 300,000 members is $20and there are no big angels. It is armed with a 10,000 square-footwarehouse, bright leadership, 65 employees and a $5 million budget.   PETA is often the clearinghouse when crimes such as arson orproperty theft occur in the battle against abuse of animals. Theyget the word from the underground groups _ Animal Liberation Front,True Friends, Human Bondage, and others.   ``We know our phones are tapped and we entertain the FBIfrequently,'' says Carol Burnett, 36, the public relations director.   Is PETA, in fact, the Animal Liberation Front, or does it knowwho the ALF members might be?   ``We would never consider discussing the identity of anyone whois talking too much,'' says executive director Ingrid Newkirk, whohas been arrested perhaps a dozen times but has yet to spend a nightin jail.   ``We have one page of company rules, but it's not like you'rejoining the army or entering a religious cult. We have a voluntaryban on smoking and ask employees not to bring in McDonald's burgers.   ``We ask people not to wear animal products to work, but we don'trun around and inspect people's apparel like the Marines. We hopeeventually people will get rid of it, but a lot of people justcoming to work here still own something made from an animal.''   There are warnings not to leave anything exposed on your deskthat is not ready for public consumption.   PETA is compartmentalized into research and investigations,education, cosmetics, a ``Whistleblower Hotline,'' and under theFreedom of Information Act, it constantly writes in for reports onpublicly funded projects.   An educational team of three _ ``Animal Rights 101'' _ flies outjust about every weekend to train local groups in how to picket andbecome effective in their community.   A dozen ``companion animals'' accompany employees to work eachday and all of the dogs are vegetarians. Some wander through thehalls, others are in offices. One is behind a closed door with hispicture and a caption that says ``Make My Day.'' But that's a joke.It's a friendly dog.   Posters are everywhere. One shows rabbits being blinded ``not inthe name of science but in the name of a new shampoo.'' There arepictures of cats with electrodes in their heads, cute young whitefoxes in cages waiting to become fur coats. ``If you liked pullingthe wings off flies as a kid,'' one sign says, ``you may be cut outfor a career in animal experimentation.''   The Foundation for Biomedical Research has recently entered theposter war. One shows a little girl in a hospital bed surrounded bystuffed animals. The caption says it's the animals you don't seethat saved her life.   PETA says it doesn't advocate violence but wouldn't be surprisedif more incidents occur.   ``If anyone brings on this violence, it's those who commit theobscenities inside the labs,'' says Alex Pacheco, its founder. ``Ifanyone is responsible for bombs going off, it's the NationalInstitutes of Health. I'm surprised there is not more violence.   `Activists are trying to get laws enforced. I work mostly withcongressmen and I find it just outrageously frustrating. Here wehave government agencies lying to the U.S. Congress, lying to thepublic and the courts are not enforcing the existing laws againstcruelty and nothing substantive has been passed in a decade.''   PETA publishes lists of companies that use animals in theirresearch and those that do not.   ``What we must make people realize is that they, as a consumer,run the world,'' Newkirk says. ``Good intentions don't mean a thingif you continue to use the product.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By KAY BARTLETT</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><TEXT>   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ The Humane Society of the United States isurging people to cut up their American Express cards because thecredit institution mailed a fur coat catalog announcing: ``Fur _Because winter is long and life is short.''   ``Follow your heart. Drop your American Express,'' theWashington-based Humane Society told its 830,000 members.   That is but one more confrontation in a burgeoning animal rights,animal welfare and animal liberation movement that has beengathering strength across the nation.   It is by no means monolithic or even united: The majority wouldnot agree with some of the direct action resulting in burnedbuildings, theft of records and research animals, and death threats.   There are large differences about philosophy and tactics. Many,for example, are unprepared to espouse vegetarianism, while othersgo so far as to feed a meatless diet to their dogs and cats to sparethe suffering of a farm animal. It also has closed down someresearch projects, caused one company to drop its cosmetics line,and improved conditions for some research animals.   Consider the following:   _More than 2,000 protesters, led by Bob Barker, walked upManhattan's Fifth Avenue the day after Thanksgiving _ ``Fur FreeFriday.'' There were smaller demonstrations in 66 other Americancities.   _A research scientist at New York University's prestigiousCornell Medical College made research history when she or theuniversity, or both, yielded to demonstrations and a letter-writingcampaign and returned a $530,000 grant to the National Institute ofDrug Abuse for a study of barbituate withdrawal in cats.   _In England, a few days before Christmas, the Animal LiberationFront claimed responsibility for firebomb attacks on five ofBritain's leading department stores, causing millions of dollars ofdamage in retaliation for selling fur. Dingles, the largest store inPlymouth, was gutted.   _President-elect George Bush drew flack for hunting quail on avacation in Texas.   _Police in Norwalk, Conn., are holding animal rights activistFran Stephanie Trutt, 33, of Queens, N.Y., on $500,000 bail as sheawaits trial on charges of attempted murder and possession of pipebombs. Trutt was arrested on Nov. 11 outside the United StatesSurgical Corp., a firm that experiments with dogs and has been afrequent target of demonstrators.   _In December, ``Bloom County,'' a political comic strip, ran aweek of satire on testing rabbits for cosmetics.   _And in Huntington, N.Y., on Long Island, a tray of vegetariandog and cat biscuits, Wow-Bow and Wow-Meow, are baked by anentrepreneurial activist.   The radical side of the movement dates back to theanti-vivisectionism of Victorian England, but interest was rekindledby a 1978 book, ``Animal Liberation,'' by Australian philosopherPeter Singer.   ``At last we're starting to look like a movement, but I thinkanimal rights is in its early stages,'' says Ingrid Newkirk, chiefstrategist and director of People for the Ethical Treatment ofAnimals (PETA), the most radical of an estimated 3,000 to 7,000groups involved in animal welfare.   A PETA spokeswoman estimates that 10 million Americans areinvolved and guesses that the operating budgets of the myriad groupscome to about $50 million. That's not counting the money held inendowments by the established giants, who tend to be less militant.   While businessmen and scientists say they are worried, activistsclaim they have never hurt a human nor an animal. Alex Pacheco, aco-founder of PETA, says arson, property destruction, burglary ortheft are ``acceptable crimes when they directly alleviate the painand suffering of an animal.'' The same goes for sit-ins, disruptionsat stockholder meetings in attempts to pass resolutions to banproduct testing on animals.   Animal rights people say the experiments are the real crime andthat 40 percent of all research animals are used for cosmetic andproduct testing, often as insurance against a theoretical lawsuit,not as safety measures.   ``Do we really need the 48th brand of oven cleaner?'' Newkirkasks.   The blitz against wearing fur is the most visible campaign. Thereare ads atop taxis, on billboards, in subways and buses. Celebritiessuch as Rue McClanahan and Loretta Swit have participated. EvenPrincess Di was commended for her refusal to wear fur.   The fur industry tries to keep the activists off the air.   Richard Parsons, executive director of the Fur RetailersInformation Council, says furriers have been asked not to giveinterviews because they tend to ``shoot themselves in the foot.''Like the time one told a reporter that all American furs arefarm-raised. Not true.   ``We can't threaten to pull our ads, because that's how we sellour furs,'' Parsons says. ``But we're big advertisers and sometimeswe get a pretty good response. Sometimes we can keep them off theair. We try.   ``We don't debate them. We don't dignify them. We don't need todefend the use of fur. It's a matter of personal freedom. This isstill a capitalistic society, and it is supposed to be a tolerantone.''   Sales have not been affected, Parsons says, although the industryis looking to increase the international levy at auction houses toincrease its war chest to combat the anti-fur forces.   ``The American fur industry has had locks jammed, arson, bombthreats and windows smashed,'' Parsons says. ``Giving this movementcredibility gives in to more violence.''   Dan Mathews, a 24-year-old PETA member in charge of the anti-furcampaign, says, ``The fur industry will be the first domino to fall.We are not asking you to change your life, just give up cruelty.''   Besides the furriers, the cosmetic industry, research scientists,and producers of livestock, eggs, chickens, and milk _ ``factoryfarmers'' as the activists call them _ are under attack.   ``So what if we put a few businesses under,'' Mathews says. ``Theslave traders lost an industry, too.''   The anti-vivisectionist faction believes that man has evolved toa point where he can live without any animal products _ meat, milk,leather, fur, wool, etc. They feel that neither the cosmeticindustry nor medical researchers have the right to experiment onanimals; that zoos, rodeos, race tracks, even the household pet isan exploitation of the animal kingdom.   ``We are not saying animals have the same rights as man,'' saysGeorge Cave of Trans-Species Unlimited. ``Sometimes, we have to makechoices.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By KEN KUSMER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former cop Michael J. Nelson once wasdescribed as ``walking a beat with one foot in the Twilight Zone.''He's in it up to his elbows now, at the price of a once-promisingcareer.   Nelson, former chief of detectives in Hendricks County west ofhere, quit when Sheriff Roy W. Waddell told him he no longer couldpursue an investigation of satanic rituals that began with a spateof grave desecrations 18 months ago.   A private investigator now, he helps alleged victims ofsatanists. But he finds there's little demand for his services.   Nelson, 40, an Indianapolis native who grew up in California andreturned here after a hitch in the Army, was a well-respecteddetective in September 1987, when an isolated complaint of gravetampering began a quiet obsession.   The headstones of a small family plot had been turned over anddesecrated in a wooded, secluded area of Hendricks County. A manwho lived nearby, after overhearing a barroom conversation, hadgone out to see for himself.   ``He was in tears, he could hardly talk, he was alleging it wasdevil worshipers,'' Nelson said in an interview in the office heconverted from his home's family room.   Rumors of satanism had permeated the county for years. Nelson,in his only previous brush with the occult, had been on patrol oncein the area when he came across what he believed was a circle ofdevil worshipers. That experience had left him shaken.   News of the grave descration prompted others to come forwardwith similar stories, and Nelson soon had 15 graves that had beendisturbed at seven sites over a year and a half. There also wereghoulish details such as reports of red-robed cultists gatheringnear the home of a convicted murderess and an alleged attack on amotorist by a hooded man with a spiked glove.   As circumstance would have it, it also was Halloween season. ByJanuary, Nelson and his ``Twilight Zone'' beat had attractednational publicity.   It was heady stuff for Nelson, but it was becoming a headachefor local officials concerned about the image of their suburbancommunity. The detective, meanwhile, was coming up with ``a ton ofleads'' but making little headway in the case.   ``Effective immediately,'' began the letter from Sheriff Waddellon Jan. 1988, ``you will discontinue any investigation of thereported disturbances of graves and the gathering of intelligencepertaining to satanic cults.''   By Feb. 15, Nelson was transferred to uniformed patrol.   ``I was taken back. I was speechless,'' Nelson said. But hepursued the investigation on his own time until he was reminded hestill represented the department and should cease and desist. Heceased being a Hendricks County deputy on May 26.   ``If the sheriff had his way, you never would have heard aboutit,'' Nelson says. ``It's hard for people to believe it does exist.   ``I think it's more important for the people to know about thisand to know how to deal with this than to keep it covered up.''   In Nelson's office, amid the law enforcement plaques andcertificates, the volumes devoted to ``Understanding HumanBehavior'' and his third wife's collection of owl figurines, hereserves a corner for occult memorabilia: voodoo dolls, pentagrams,record albums by heavy metal bands such as Motley Crue andMegadeth, and confiscated notebooks in which devilish rites aredetailed.   Satanists are guilty of not only grave robbery but also arson,rape, kidnapping, brainwashing and even child sacrifice, Nelsonsays. He compares the public apathy to the light regard for thedrug culture in the 1950s. ``Look at us now,'' he says.   ``The whole criminal justice system is inept when it comes tothese kinds of allegations,'' he says.   ``We've got to get people to believe. People believe it occursonly in television and movies, but it doesn't. It's out there. It'ssucking up adolescents left and right.''   Dale Griffis of Tiffin, Ohio, a former police detective and nowa widely respected consultant on such matters, agrees with Nelson.   `There's a lot of catch-up ball being played now'' by lawenforcement officials and mental health professionals, Griffis says.   Nelson as a private detective, however, hasn't been able toattract much business. He said he sometimes regrets leaving thesheriff's department, and has inquired about joining other policeagencies, but his age is working against him. And he won't give uptrying to expose satanists.   Nelson shares what he's learned in lectures and police seminars,but receives little compensation for it other than his expenses.He's writing a book, but confesses he needs help organizing it anddoesn't have a publisher lined up.   His last occult-related case was in December, when he was hiredto help in a civil suit a Michigan woman was pursuing to help herdaughter and grandchild, whom the woman thought faced a threat ofchild sacrifice, Nelson says.   He takes on non-occult work as well, but there isn't enough toput food on the table. That's up to his wife, Phyllis, who directssecurity at a local auto plant.   ``If my wife didn't have a good job we'd be starving,'' he says.	</TEXT><NOTE>By MALCOLM RITTER</NOTE><NOTE>AP Science Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Chief swept into the hospital lobby,handing his hat, coat and books to the waiting crowd, dispensing acheery greeting and a wave of his hand.   He led them past the outstretched arms of the 10-foot marbleChrist and down the long corridor to the first ward. Gathering at abed, spectators focused their attention on the patient. And on TheChief.   William Osler, a showman with high forehead and the boldmustache of a pirate, was in his element. He was teaching medicalstudents at the bedside. And he was making history.   For this was Johns Hopkins Hospital around the turn of thecentury. And Osler was among a small group of physicians who werehelping change the way America trained its doctors.   With the opening of the hospital in 1889 and the Hopkins medicalschool in 1893, Osler and his colleagues became the first Americanmedical faculty to demand a college degree from incoming students.They also put a new emphasis on research and on learning byexperience.   ``From the outset, Johns Hopkins embodied a conception ofmedical education as a field of graduate study, rooted in basicscience and hospital medicine, that was eventually to govern allinstitutions in the country,'' wrote sociologist Paul Starr in hisPulitzer Prize-winning book, ``The Social Transformation ofAmerican Medicine.''   As Hopkins graduates became professors and scientists all overthe country and abroad, ``they took a major part in shaping thecharacter of medical education and research in the 20th century,''Starr wrote.   This month marks 100 years of medicine at Johns Hopkins MedicalInstitutions. The U.S. Postal Service planned to issue a $1 JohnsHopkins stamp, and the prestigious Journal of the American MedicalAssociation dedicated its June 2 issue to new research from Hopkins.   The Hopkins influence on medicine extends beyond medicaleducation. In the past century, researchers there developed theradical mastectomy for breast cancer, built the first renaldialysis apparatus, crystallized insulin and made many other keycontributions.   The Hopkins medical school opened its doors at a time whenAmerica had some good medical schools, but also many poor ones,medical historian Lester S. King said in a recent interview.   No national standards yet governed medical education. Just aboutanybody could get into a medical school somewhere, often withouteven a high school education. Some diploma mills conferred a degreein less than a year.   Schools had to compete for access to hospitals and clinics wherestudents could get some training with patients. Most schools couldnot offer much bedside experience.   In general, American medical schools also lacked laboratoryfacilities and conducted only limited original research. Germany,by contrast, was leading a scientific transformation of medicinethat began in the mid-19th century, fueled by advances inmicroscopy, chemistry and physiology.   In America, reformers had been pressing for tougher academicstandards, noted University of Minnesota medical historian LeonardG. Wilson. The reformers argued that medical students needed a muchbetter background to study medicine effectively at a time of manyadvances in such areas as surgery, pathology, bacteriology andbiology.   But some medical school professors opposed raising entrancestandards. It might discourage a natural genius in the art ofhealing, they said. And a school that raised its requirementsrisked losing students to less-rigorous institutions _ no smallconsideration at a time when medical schools depended largely onstudent fees.   Some of the better schools made major academic improvementsduring the 1870s and 1880s. And in 1874, one key reformer told thetrustees in charge of establishing Hopkins hospital and universitythat they had a ``precious'' chance to set up a top-notch school oftheir own.   ``No medical school already organized has anything like youropportunity,'' said Charles Eliot, president of Harvard University.   The Hopkins trustees had some major advantages. Rather thanbattling entrenched dogma and professors they could start fromscratch. And rather than having to persuade a hospital to letstudents into wards, they could make the hospital a teaching toolfrom the beginning.

He led them past the outstretched arms of the 10-foot marbleChrist and down the long corridor to the first ward. Gathering at abed, spectators focused their attention on the patient. And on TheChief.   William Osler, a showman with high forehead and the boldmustache of a pirate, was in his element. He was teaching medicalstudents at the bedside. And he was making history.   For this was Johns Hopkins Hospital around the turn of thecentury. And Osler was among a small group of physicians who werehelping change the way America trained its doctors.   With the opening of the hospital in 1889 and the Hopkins medicalschool in 1893, Osler and his colleagues became the first Americanmedical faculty to demand a college degree from incoming students.They also put a new emphasis on research and on learning byexperience.   ``From the outset, Johns Hopkins embodied a conception ofmedical education as a field of graduate study, rooted in basicscience and hospital medicine, that was eventually to govern allinstitutions in the country,'' wrote sociologist Paul Starr in hisPulitzer Prize-winning book, ``The Social Transformation ofAmerican Medicine.''   This month marks 100 years of medicine at Johns Hopkins MedicalInstitutions.   The Hopkins influence on medicine extends beyond medicaleducation. In the past century, researchers there developed theradical mastectomy for breast cancer, built the first renaldialysis apparatus, crystallized insulin and made many other keycontributions.   The Hopkins medical school opened its doors at a time whenAmerica had some good medical schools, but also many poor ones,medical historian Lester S. King said in a recent interview.   No national standards yet governed medical education.   Schools had to compete for access to hospitals and clinics wherestudents could get some training with patients. Most schools couldnot offer much bedside experience.   In general, American medical schools also lacked laboratoryfacilities and conducted only limited original research. Germany,by contrast, was leading a scientific transformation of medicinethat began in the mid-19th century, fueled by advances inmicroscopy, chemistry and physiology.   The Hopkins trustees had some major advantages. Rather thanbattling entrenched dogma and professors they could start fromscratch. And rather than having to persuade a hospital to letstudents into wards, they could make the hospital a teaching toolfrom the beginning.   When it came to opening the medical school, however, they alsohad a big problem.   As trustees of the estate of Baltimore financier Johns Hopkins,they were in charge of what was then the largest endowment inAmerican history. The $7 million Hopkins left upon his death in1873 was to be used for establishing the hospital and a university.

By prodding cancerous cells out of their immature state of wildreproduction and toward a more normal specialized form, thetreatment aims to stodenizens of thp the uncontrolled growth that characterizescancer.   Researchers hope that approach will let them attack cancer cellsthat resist current drugs and reduce the serious side effects ofchemotherapy.   Big obstacles remain before ``differentiation therapy'' couldbecome part of standard treatment, scientists say. But evenobservers not involved in the recent human trials in Europe, Asiaand the United States say they see reason for hope.   ``As a basic idea, it'sappear anyway.   Apart from issues of therapy, scientists are looking for helpfrom basic research. Better drugs may result if researchers candefine just what signals trigger differentiation in normal andcancerous cells.   One target for study is oncogenes, malfunctioning versions ofsome normal genes, which turn a cell cancerous. Another possibilityhas been discovered only recently: suppressor genes, oranti-oncogenes, which appear to inhibit the transformation to cancer.   International collaborations of scientists and physicians are nowstudying differentiation factors, and the cooperation should shortenthe time needed to develop the potential, says Waxman, who helpsorganize annual meetings of differentiation researchers.   Despite the unanswered questions, researchers say they believedifferentiation drugs may one day play a significant part in thebattle against cancer.   ``We've got gold here,'' Sartorelli says, ``if we can mine itappropriately and exploit it.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARCIA DUNN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Outdoorsman and writer Ed Zern, aconservationist with a sense of humor, is still spouting theone-liners that have endeared him so long to so many anglers.   ``I prefer any kind of fishing to any kind of work,'' the78-year-old Zern likes to say.

She said, `Oh, no, it isn'tthat. We've been married 52 years and this is the first time we'veever stayed at a hotel.'''   Zern's passion for the outdoors was nurtured by his father, whoheaded West Virginia University's Department of Mines during the1910s. The elder Zern often took his young son on inspection trips.   ``I would see what the mine drainage had done to the stream,''he recalls.   Zern caught his first trout at age 5. The next year, his familymoved from West Virginia to the Pittsburgh area.   Since then, Zern has fished and hunted on five continents.   Occasionally, sometimes by accident and sometimes not, Zernrepeats himself in his ``Exit Laughing'' column, which he began in1958. It never goes unnoticed.   ``I always get three or four letters and I hae the same answerto all of them,'' he says.   ``I say, `Dear Mr. Thompson, Thank you for your letter of suchand such a date. The last time I heard the Philadelphia Orchestra,they played the Brahms First and I understand they've done itseveral times before. Sincerely yours.'''   So just where does he get his ideas?   ``I wish I had one,'' he says. ``I've got a piece due the dayafter tomorrow. It was a lot easier when I was younger andsmart-aleckier than I am now.''   He also suffers now from Parkinson's disease, which causes hishands to tremble and consequently prevents him from shifting from amanual typewriter to an electric typewriter or computer.   Nevertheless, Zern is at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y., only abouthalf the time. The rest of the time he's on the road.   His favorite sport, and writing topic, is fishing. Like manyserious anglers, he tosses his catch back into the water.   Zern doesn't feel the least bit sorry for the uninitiated.   ``I'm rather glad everybody doesn't like fishing or the goodfishing places would be so overpopulated,'' he says. ``So I'd neverknowingly write anything that would encourage anybody to gofishing. You can always build more bowling alleys or tennis courts.You can't build more trout streams.''   His sentiments are shared by his program's awardees.   Among the 11 citizen volunteers honored this year were a Juneau,Alaska, couple who have developed a school curriculum on marine andwetlands resources, and a Milwaukee man who has led a campaign toestablish a national park in American Samoa.   Ten professional conservationists also received $1,000 and abronze plaque, including a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologistfrom Massachusetts who is working to save the threatened PipingPlover, a shore bird.   The five group finalists included the United Anglers of CasaGrande High School in Petaluma, Calif., which is rehabilitatinglocal waterways so fish can migrate upstream. The 30 to 40 studentsare raising money for a new hatchery to replace one that failed tomeet earthquake standards.   Zern says he has no real way of knowing whether the awardsprogram or any of his other efforts have had, or will have, asignificant effect.   ``We don't really know how many souls are saved,'' he says, ``nomatter how tough the sermon.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARCUS ELIASON</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SARK, Channel Islands (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Trapped in a time warp betweenEngland and France, the tiny island of Sark clings to its feudalways, resolutely shunning such 20th-century delights as cars,planes and income tax.   With high cliffs set in a fickle sea, and a perplexingconstitutional setup to keep the foreigners guessing, Sark remainswhat the Victorian poet Algernon Charles Swinburne called a``small, sweet world of wave-encompassed wonder.''   Its 560 people are ruled by a ``seigneur'' whose privilegesinclude the sole right to keep pigeons and female dogs, and aparliament with 40 hereditary members and 12 elected deputies.   Land on the 4-square-mile island cannot be sold without theseigneur's permission, and every real estate deal nets him a 7.5percent commission. And if he wished, he could sell the wholeisland to a new seigneur, subject to royal permission.   Sark is part of the Channel Island archipelago in the EnglishChannel, which makes it British but not part of the United Kingdom.So while London takes care of such trivia as defense and foreignaffairs, Sark's parliament wrestles with the major issues, likewhether to reroute horse-and-carriage traffic to keep horsedroppings off the main street.   There are no paved roads, drugs, sex crimes or pollution.   Sark's sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, but in her capacity asDuke (not Duchess) of Normandy. It's an anachronism which, likeSark's French place names, attests to the ebb and flow of Frenchand English conquest over the centuries.   Spring sunshine is already brightening the cliffs of Sark as themorning boat from Guernsey finishes its bumpy 7-mile voyage andjostles gently into place against the limpet-encrusted jetty.   Islanders and early-season tourists disembark and wobble up thestone stairs. Some clamber aboard a tractor-towed wagon for aone-minute journey into ``town.'' A lady carrying a potted plant iscarried grandly away in a horse-drawn carriage. A few brave soulsprefer the footpath up the savagely steep hill, walking throughcarpets of blue wildflowers.   A short ride by rented bicycle down The Avenue, Sark's mainstreet, leads past the island's one pay phone and mailbox to theSeigneurie, the gardened mansion where 61-year-old Michael Beaumontexerts benign lordship over Sark.   Beaumont inherited the title from his grandmother, theredoubtable Dame Sybil Hathaway who ruled Sark for 47 years andbecame world-renowned as the woman who kept the 20th century at bay.   She it was who fended off every bureaucrat, mainland or local,who tried to tamper with Sark's ways. It was, she wrote, ``a battlefor existence'' against ``men who can take off for the moon butcannot be reasonable and leave people in peace in this world...''   She refused to flee when the Wehrmacht overran Sark, and whenWorld War II was over the captured German occupiers were made tofix the roads their tanks and trucks had damaged.   In 1969 she threatened to abdicate rather than let Chief Pleas,the island parliament, change the law banning cars.   When she died in 1974 at age 90, many wondered whether Sarkwould finally emerge from its time capsule. But Beaumont hasfaithfully guarded his grandmother's legacy.   The seigneurship was quite a career change. He was an engineerworking on guided missiles in Bristol when, as eldest son of thedame's eldest son, he inherited Sark.   He's an affable, soft-spoken man of 61 who prefers open-neckedshirts and believes in hands-off government. ``A lot of the powerof the seigneur,'' he says, ``is in his ability NOT to do things,rather than to do things.''   Does Sark have any problems? He can't think of any serious ones.	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>TASHKENT, U.S.S.R.

The number of students in Islamic academies is being doubled andthe number of Korans and other religious books being published willbe greatly increased. The Kremlin is removing a Stalin-era ban ongroup religious education and plans to allow believers to organizecharities.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Little Junior Ramey, who was West Virginia'syoungest mayor before he was sent to prison, is back in town andplanning on getting back into politics.   But James Ramey Jr. III has a family reputation to live down, orlive up to, depending on who's doing the talking.   A lot of folks hereabouts have fond memories of his father,James Ramey Jr., who before his death in a federal penitentiary in1983 had become known as West Virginia's greatest con artist.   ``He could sell you anything, whether he had it or not,'' saysLittle Junior, who is back running his diner, where the menufeatures things like chicken and dumplings and corn bread. ``Hecould convince you your black jacket was white.''   Despite making his living as a con man, Junior Ramey was electedtime after time as a county constable. The citizens of Wayne alsoelected his wife, Louise Ramey, a justice of the peace. And theyelected his son, James Ramey Jr. III, mayor of the town at thetender age of 22.   Ramey, now 26, resigned that job in 1987 after he pleaded guiltyto a tax evasion charge and was sentenced to two years in a federalprison _ a sentence that many people consider to have been unfair.Regardless of that, Ramey is back in Wayne, having been releasedfrom prison on parole in January 1988. He plans to run for mayor inJune, after he completes his parole.   ``I always said that I didn't know which it was that got me thatjail sentence _ being Junior Ramey's son or being the mayor ofWayne,'' Ramey says. ``Any other person that got caught for what Idid wouldn't have gotten two years in prison. If I'd been anaverage small business person, they would just have made me fileand pay my taxes.''   At first, Ramey says he was reluctant to seek office again,fearing that it was his prominence as the youngest mayor in thestate that helped get him a jail sentence.   ``But everybody in this town kept insisting for me to runagain,'' Ramey says. ``And I like being a small town mayor. It'snot like real politics; it's just trying to do your best to helpyour community.''   The town of Wayne, population 1,495, has indeed supported theRameys. When Little Junior pleaded guilty to the tax charge, nearly1,100 people put their signatures on a petition urging that theyoung mayor be given probation and community service work for hissentence.   But it's said the ghost of Junior Ramey raised its head at theyounger Ramey's sentencing. Once a Ramey, always a Ramey, theprosecutor said a day before the 1987 tax filing deadline.   ``People can either sit down tomorrow night and do the rightthing, or look at Mr. Ramey and feel they've been taken,''assistant U.S. attorney Joe Savage said in asking U.S. DistrictJudge Charles Haden to impose a jail term on the young mayor.   ``The legacy of Junior Ramey apparently remains with us today,''Savage told Haden, who also had sentenced the famed con artist.   This raft of Rameys tends to confuse outsiders. After all, JamesRamey Jr. had eight wives and 13 children. One of the sons wasnamed James Robert Ramey, another was named James Ramey Jr. II andwas known as Big Junior. Thus, James Ramey Jr. III, the youngest,came to be called Little Junior.   Although he never really asked for an explanation of the muddlednames, Little Junior has a pretty good idea why his father namedhis sons as he did.   ``It probably had to do with confusing the IRS,'' Rameyexplains. ``And if somebody came in here looking for Junior Ramey,we could always say he wasn't here.''   And somebody was always looking for Junior Ramey.   ``He was good at what he done, no question,'' Ramey says of hisfather. ``Everybody here knew what my father did for a living, buthe always took his money from the rich people. The people of thistown always liked my father, and the people he beat out usuallywere looking for something for nothing.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A boy walking by Radio City Music Hall saw a bigpicture of Ella Fitzgerald, advertising her upcoming concert. ``Ah,Ella!'' he cried, then he threw his arms wide and embraced the glassover the poster.   You can show her picture or say ``Ella'' any place in the worldand people know who you mean: America's first lady of song.   The 6,000-seat Music Hall sold out fast. After more than 50 yearsin show business, Miss Fitzgerald hasn't tired of those appearances.These days, her doctor sanctions a couple of dates a month. Thelongest she's been away from the public was nine months, after her1986 heart attack and a bypass operation.   ``I love to sing and I love people,'' she says. ``I try to givepeople love through singing and make them happy.''   It was Yale men and their dates at a dance 54 years ago who putElla in show business. From the stage, in the shy, modest tone ofsomebody unaware of her own greatness, she always thanks the publicfor keeping her there.   When she arrived in New York from singing in Palm Springs twodays before her Radio City concert, a wealthy fan gave her a party.``He had a cake made with my picture on it. Neil Sedaka was there,Tony Bennett, Jon Hendricks. We got up and jammed; we were supposedto be doing `Lady Be Good.' You never heard such a `Lady Be Good.' ''   Liza Minnelli and Whitney Houston, who were unable to attend,sent notes of regret, which Miss Fitzgerald took home to keep.   She travels with an 8-by-10 photograph of her 3-year-oldgranddaughter, Alice, who lives in Seattle. ``She likes country andwestern. She sings, `You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.'''Alice's singing is imitated by her famous grandmother.   Imitating is one of the things Miss Fitzgerald does best. InRadio City, she sings ``Ghost of a Chance'' like she thinks it wouldbe done by a tenor saxophone, trades scat phrases with bassistKeeter Betts and offers a Louis Armstrong-like growl in herflag-waving final encore, ``Mack the Knife.''   In a voice that is light, girlish and true, she slips easily inand out of jazz, always swinging. When Norman Granz became hermanager in 1954, he bought her contract from Decca Records and beganrecording her on his own new label, Verve. Instead of easing herslowly from jazz into the day's pop hits, he boldly moved her intoclassy popular music. Her first Verve recording was ``The ColePorter Songbook.''   She'd been traveling with Dizzy Gillespie and was apprehensiveabout drastically changing styles. ``I'd been singing be-bop. Ithought the man was trying to get me out of the business.''   Instead, ``The Cole Porter Songbook'' introduced the singer to alarger, non-jazz audience. The record was followed by other``songbooks'' devoted to the music of Gershwin, Ellington, Rodgersand Hart, Berlin, Arlen, Kern and others. These days, MissFitzgerald sweetly reminds audiences, ``They're available on CD.''   If there was anybody left who didn't know Ella Fitzgerald, theymet her through commercials. She sang for Memorex tapes and a glassshattered. ``Kids liked it. They'd always ask me when I'm going tobreak another glass. We get on an airplane and pilots say, `Whateveryou do, don't sing next to the window.'''   Slimmed down from her previous look as a comfortably plumpgrandmother, she posed for Annie Leibovitz for an American Expressad. The photographer chose a red dress, hat and leopard coat fromMiss Fitzgerald's closet, posed her by her old convertible that hadto be pushed into place and said something a bit raunchy _ MissFitzgerald doesn't say what _ to put a ``foxy lady'' look on herface.   ``She got me snazzy,'' the singer smiles. ``People take thatpicture out of magazines and ask me to autograph them.'' They alsorecognize her voice singing ``Isn't It Romantic'' in AmericanExpress TV ads as a couple loses a credit card in Venice and picksup a replacement in Beijing.	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Acting in the comedy ``Cafe Crown,'' atBroadway's Brooks Atkinson Theater, is ``like being in a musicalwithout having to sing,'' says Anne Jackson.   ``It's such a joyous play to do. There are 18 actors; it's anensemble piece. Audiences seem to have a really good time.''   Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson's husband of 41 years, plays flamboyantimpresario-actor David Cole in ``Cafe Crown.'' His actress wifeplays his actress wife.   ``Cafe Crown'' is a revival of Hy Kraft's 1942 comedy, which wasthe first Broadway success for director Elia Kazan. It's set in thereal Cafe Royal, which opened in 1920 amid 80 Yiddish theaters, ahaven for deal-making actors and eccentric waiters.   Wallach's character is fighting to keep Yiddish theater alive.Another character, a gifted young actor based on Paul Muni, wants toleave the Yiddish theater for Hollywood.   ``Remember those ads, `You don't have to be Jewish to like Levy'srye bread?''' Wallach says. ``You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy`Cafe Crown.'   ``It's a family play, well-plotted. The play reflects Hy Kraft'spersonality. There is no meanness in it, no discomfort.   ``The decline of the Yiddish theater was based on the fact thatyoung people didn't want to learn Yiddish,'' Wallach adds. ``Ididn't learn it. When my parents argued, they spoke Polish, Germanor Yiddish.''   Wallach's most difficult acting in ``Cafe Crown'' is telling theyoung actor he'll release him from his contract, giving him a chanceat Hollywood. ``It's a very moving thing to me,'' Wallach says. ``Isay, `What right have I to demand your sacrifice?' One generation issaying to another, `We must move on.'It's in only two lines. Inacting, you just have to go along with the notes _ like music.''   The couple has acted together in Murray Schisgal's ``The Typistand the Tiger,'' ``Luv'' and ``Twice Around the Park.''   ``Cafe Crown'' opened in October off-Broadway at the PublicTheater. A hit, it moved to Broadway Feb. 18. Fyvush Finkel andFelix Fibich, both veterans of Yiddish theater, are in the cast. Sois Bob Dishy.   Wallach turned down a film to do the Broadway run. ``The moviewas interesting but I love doing the play,'' he says. ``I didn'twant to go to Germany for two months. I'd rather spend it onBroadway.''   In 1953 he turned down the role of Maggio _ which then went toFrank Sinatra _ in the film ``From Here to Eternity.'' He says, ``Itwas the choice between that or a brilliant play by TennesseeWilliams, `Camino Real,' where he'd tailored a role for me. Kazanwas directing. It wasn't an act of heroism. It was a choice.   ``I'm a contented actor. I read of actors making $800,000. I'mhappy doing what I'm doing.   ``Once the ego drive to be in the limelight, to make a killing,to be the biggest, flattens out, you begin to relish the work forthe work.   ``We paid our dues in the theater,'' says Wallach. ``We spentyears working with great stars, learning from the ground up. We werebequeathed certain values in the theater that are important to us.So when we find projects we want to do, we do them.''   Miss Jackson is writing a second book. Her first, ``EarlyStages,'' ends with the birth of the couple's son, now a marriedfather of two little boys who's working on special effects on ``StarTrek 5.'' The couple's two daughters are actresses, one married, onegetting married in May.   Though they also act independently, Miss Jackson says, ``We dohave a lot of fun working together. We're both quite good characteractors. The characterizations that we come up with make it seem likeit's a different person we're relating to.''   Wallach's acting in ``Cafe Crown'' changes, he says, depending onwhat Bob Dishy does as the legendary Cafe Royal busboy. ``I neverknow if he's going to be polite or irascible. There's a littlemystery in his acting, which is why he's always interesting.''   The rather small part of Mrs. Cole originally didn't appeal toMiss Jackson. ``I thought they just wanted me because of Eli. When Igot involved in it, I realized it was better than I thought,'' shesays.   ``Her role is very important in `Cafe Crown,''' says Wallach.``They talk about her before she comes on. She has one scene with meand one scene in the final act. It's really not much. But it's socarefully woven into the fabric of the play that the characteremerges very strongly.''   ``It was a surprise to me,'' the actress says. ``And it's fun toplay.''   One day, during the off-Broadway run, Miss Jackson climbed on achair in their apartment, fell and missed four performances. Wallachopens his mouth to comment on her understudy, hears ``Be carefulwhat you say about how good she was'' from his spouse and saysmildly, ``I was happy when you came back.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actress Joanne Woodward is turning historian,tapping memories to re-create a revolution in American acting ledby the late Lee Strasberg and the Group Theater.   ``For a long time I'd wanted to do something about the GroupTheater,'' she says. ``I didn't quite know what. When Lee died, Isuddenly panicked and said, `Pretty soon there won't be anybodyleft to tell the tale.'''   Now, she is hosting ``Broadway's Dreamers: the Legacy of theGroup Theater,'' the first program in the fourth season of the``American Masters'' series on PBS. It will be televised on June 26.   For Miss Woodward, it is the end product of five years ofinterviews, wedged into a busy career, which accounts for herchanging hair colors and styles on-screen. There is also archivalfootage of the 1931-41 Group Theater.   What surprised her most about her interview subjects, she says,``is their depth of involvement and how immediate it was. Theyremembered everything like it was yesterday. It is 50 years ago andthey're saying, `Lee said this and I said this.'''   Founders of the Group Theater were Strasberg, who taught methodacting, director Harold Clurman and casting director CherylCrawford. They were dismayed at the lack of real life in thedrawing room comedies of the 1920s. So they created the GroupTheater to perform original American plays which would mirror _ andthey hoped would change _ the life of their times.   In the Depression they banded together with 28 actors who agreedto use an ensemble approach to acting. Most were in their 20s.   Katharine Hepburn, interviewed briefly during the show, saysthat at 21 she attended one planning meeting for the Group Theaterand declined to join. She said she told them, ``I want to be astar.''   Miss Woodward says, ``I'd heard that story for years. I alwayskind of thought it was apocryphal.''   Elia Kazan recalls joining, as an apprentice, the second year.Instead of the Group Theater paying him, he paid $20 a week. Whenhe ran out of money, he waited tables. John Garfield joined in 1934.   Miss Woodward is shown, in 1987, directing ``Golden Boy'' inWilliamstown, Mass., during the 90-minute TV show. The GroupTheater first performed that Clifford Odets play in 1937.   ``Young actors (in Williamstown) had a hard time. You had toexplore that naive passion,'' Miss Woodward says. ``That kind ofnaivete I think disappeared in World War II.''   The person seen most in the show is Robert Lewis, an originalGroup Theater member who now teaches acting. ``Bobby rememberseverything in detail,'' Miss Woodward says. ``When in doubt we cutto Bobby. Isn't he funny?''   The actress studied acting with Sanford Meisner, an originalmember of the Group Theater. Her husband, Paul Newman, studied withStrasberg.   She would like to have made the show more theatrical. ``I hadvisions of Bobby going with me to some of the camps where theyworked in the summer. There was not time nor money.   ``My dream is now to do a film about the Group Theater. I'mconvinced there is a great deal more to be said. I would direct it.I think that whole period is fascinating. It has never really beenexamined. I would imagine one would have to dramatize it, in afictitious way. There are still, surprisingly enough, quite a fewpeople around who were actively involved.''   The Group Theater did change American theater. For one thing, in1933 it presented ``Men in White,'' Broadway's first hospital play.Now hospitals have become a staple of theater, film and soap opera.   After the Group Theater dissolved, some one-time members werecalled before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Somecareers were ruined.   The 14-week ``American Masters'' season, presented by WNET-NewYork, focuses on people in the creative arts who have shapedAmerican and world culture.   Miss Woodward has a busy summer ahead. Daughter Clea getsmarried. Then Mr. Newman and Mrs. Newman will rehearse their titleroles in a James Ivory-Ismail Merchant film, ``Mr. Bridge and Mrs.Bridge.''   She also attends Sarah Lawrence College. ``I went to college fortwo years. I started back about 1974. It's going to be the longestBA anybody has ever known. You don't major at Sarah Lawrence. Ijust take lots of things. I'm taking playwriting. It's great fun.''   Returning to the subject of the Group Theater, she says, ``Morethan anything else, it refocused the life of the American theater.Author Joseph Campbell talks about following your bliss. Theyfollowed their bliss.   ``There may have been more brilliant theater movements, likeOrson Welles', or more intellectually amazing, like Eva LeGallienne's. There was none that more desired change or were morepassionate for the truth.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As they struggled through a snowstorm toward atheater in a small town, actress Rosemary Prinz's husband once saidto her, ``You don't care where you act, do you?''   ``You're right, I don't,'' was her answer then. Still is.   ``You give me a good play and a good part and Bogalusa suddenlyis like Broadway,'' says Miss Prinz.   Right now Miss Prinz is happily studying the title role in``Driving Miss Daisy.'' ``It's such a beautiful play and wonderfulpart,'' she says. ``I'm thrilled to be doing it.''   While Julie Harris is on a national tour in ``Driving MissDaisy'' through January, Miss Prinz begins a ``bus-and-truck'' tour,playing mostly one-nighters in smaller cities, in October. InJanuary, she takes over from Miss Harris on the national tour whichwill last through April.   Her husband, jazz drummer Joe Patti, may go with her on the touras road manager.   Some know Miss Prinz from TV soap operas, especially as Penny on``As the World Turns.'' She has been in several Broadway plays, from``The Grey-Eyed People'' opposite Walter Matthau in 1952 to, mostrecently, ``Tribute,'' starring Jack Lemmon in 1978.   Her acting career began at 16 with a tour of ``Joan ofLorraine,'' when she played the king's mistress and Diana Barrymoreplayed St. Joan.   As well as not minding tours, she says, ``I'm an actor whodoesn't mind long runs. I love keeping it fresh, making it like I'venever heard it before or said it before. I find that verychallenging.   ``I love peeling away the layers and finding all that richnessunderneath.''   Miss Daisy, the Atlanta native who gains some insights from herchauffeur during the play, has a rich personality for an actress todiscover, Miss Prinz says.   Ted Lange, the bartender on television's ``The Love Boat,'' willplay the chauffeur.   Miss Prinz's most recent role was the mother, for 840performances, of off-Broadway's ``Steel Magnolias,'' which is set ina beauty parlor. Much was made of the fact that she broke MaryMartin's record, set in ``South Pacific,'' for the number of timesgetting her hair washed on stage. ``I couldn't believe they weremaking such a fuss,'' the actress says. ``Is that what I want to beremembered for?''   During each performance of ``Steel Magnolias,'' which is stillrunning, Miss Prinz also had her hair conditioned, set, dried undera dryer, combed out and teased.   ``It was supposed to look like a blond football helmet,'' shesays. ``If I had an audition or a party, I sometimes had to wash ittwo or three more times a week and blow it dry. My hair held upbeautifully. It's been a long time in show business, this hair.''   As Miss Daisy, who ages from 72 to 97 during the play's 26scenes, she'll wear a gray wig. ``That means my hair will lookdreadful for the entire tour,'' Miss Prinz says. ``Hair under a wigis just awful.''   Miss Daisy is the oldest character that Miss Prinz has everplayed, but she did portray the 82-year-old mother in ``Twigs,'' afour-act play in which one actress plays, in succession, threesisters and their mother. ``That's such fun. It's a wonderful playto do because you get to keep stretching those acting muscles.''   Miss Prinz has been cast in some blockbuster stage parts, shesays, because people had seen her on ``As the World Turns'' from1956 to '68.   ``In the 12 years I was Penny, I did 40 plays,'' she says. Theywere ``commercial'' _ Neil Simon plays, ``I Do, I Do,'' Mama Rose in``Gypsy.'' She kept pushing her agent to get her ``arty'' plays _Tennessee Williams, Chekhov, where soap opera stars are suspect.   ``Once I got that started, about 10 years ago,'' she says, ``theyrealized I was a serious actress.'' Her start was at the MilwaukeeRepertory Company in Williams' ``The Glass Menagerie'' and SamShepard's ``Buried Child.''   Since then she has been in ``Long Day's Journey into Night,''five different productions of ``The Glass Menagerie.'' Someday she'dlike to play Blanche in ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' and LadyMacbeth.   ``I'm having the best time of my career right now,'' Miss Prinzsays. ``I keep working on the kind of plays I've always wanted todo. I won't do anything any more that I think is not good.''   She has done other TV soaps, but only for short periods. ``I wason `Ryan's Hope' for awhile while I was in `Steel Magnolias.'   ``In 1970, the creator of `All My Children' wanted instantratings. In those days (two years' after her 12 years as Penny) Icould give it to her. I took a five-month contract. I said, `I wantAmy to be opposed to the Vietnam War and work for civil rights.' Itwasn't what the show was about but I wasn't just sitting around atable drinking coffee and talking about who was sleeping with who.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   David Sanborn, probably the world's onlyprofessional alto saxophone player hosting a TV variety show, saysthat even the sponsors seem surprised at the favorable ratings.   Since October, Sanborn has been co-host of ``Sunday Night,'' aweekly late-night musical variety show on NBC affiliates. Hisco-host is Jools Holland, keyboardist in the English pop bandSqueeze, who once hosted an English TV musical variety show, ``TheTube.''   ``The ratings have been pretty good,'' Sanborn says. ``I think itsurprised everybody, the sponsors included. It's not exactly awonderful time slot, 12:30 Sunday nights.''   Sanborn, 43, had his first band and cut the first of his dozenrecordings in 1975. He played with the Chicago-style PaulButterfield Blues Band for four years starting in 1967. He alsotoured with Stevie Wonder, Gil Evans, the Rolling Stones, DavidBowie, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Rickie Lee Jones, the BreckerBrothers and others.   He's been a semi-regular with the band on ``Late Night with DavidLetterman.''   The idea for the variety show, he says, ``was presented to me asa situation where guest musicians would sit in with a house band andit would be a pretty eclectic mix of musicians. That appealed to me.   ``I thought it would be worthwhile doing, to show people whoordinarily wouldn't get to be on commercial TV, like Eddie Palmieri,David `Fathead' Newman, Betty Wright, Al Green, Marianne Faithfull,NRBQ, Sonny Rollins, Slim Gaillard. If we can do something of highquality on TV and people like it, we've accomplished something.''   Working on ``Sunday Night,'' plus compiling a weekly radio jazzshow, has left Sanborn with no time to tour.   ``I've been fairly successful,'' he says. I've been able to makea living and I'm very grateful for it. I didn't become a musician tomake a lot of money.''   On ``Sunday Night,'' Sanborn plays the saxophone every week.   He says, ``On an ideal show, we get somebody contemporary and anartist who has been around a longer time. Ivan Neville is a youngsinger and Ruth Brown has been around since the 1950s. That would bea model show.   ``We'd like to get Robert Cray with Albert King, Eric Claptonwith Etta James, Bonnie Raitt with Koko Taylor. A great idea wouldbe Tammy Wynette and Elvis Costello. That's a tough one.''   The biggest problem with ``Sunday Night'' so far, Sanborn says,has been finding musicians whose touring schedules permit them toappear.   Another problem is the lack of time for talk. ``It'sinfuriating,'' Sanford says. ``You have 30 seconds to do an in-depthinterview with a musician. There's no way you can avoid soundingsuperficial.''   Sanborn's ``The Jazz Show'' is syndicated, for the third season,to about 150 radio stations by Westwood One Radio Network.   Eating brown rice and millet during an interview in his smallManhattan apartment, Sanborn, who is divorced, says, ``I try to livepretty healthy, given the schedule that I have.   ``In an ordinary week, we rehearse Monday and Tuesday for TV,tape Wednesday, rehearse Thursday and Friday, tape another showSaturday and do the radio show on Sunday. I don't know if I have thestamina to keep the radio show going.''   He tours with a band in the summertime. ``In 1988, I was inEurope, Japan, Hong Kong and had a few dates on the West Coast,'' hesays. ``This summer I'll tour in the States. I'll play a lot ofindoor-outdoor pavilions and 2,000 to 5,000-seat theaters. Most ofmy audience is concentrated in the big cities.''   On his most recent album, ``Close-Up,'' on Reprise, Sanborn doessome jazz-style improvising. ``But I think the rhythmic orientation,which is to me what defines the idiom, is more rhythm 'n' blues thanjazz,'' he says.   His biggest selling album was ``A Change of Heart,'' out in 1987.``After I do something, I kind of dump the information about it. Iremember that because it did so well. My last four or five albumshave sold around half a million. That one sold about 650,000.''   Sanborn also practices every day, as he has been doing since hestarted playing saxophone at age 11 in St. Louis. ``David Newman andHank Crawford were my idols back then,'' he says. ``They were in RayCharles' band. I had their records and heard them live.   ``I had David Newman on `Sunday Night.' It was a real thrill.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dion is turning 50, but he's ready to rock 'n'roll till he's in a rocking chair.   As a teen-ager in the Bronx, Dion DiMucci put together a groupof singers and named it for the neighborhood's Belmont Avenue. Dionand the Belmonts became the most popular vocal group of rock 'n'roll's doo-wop era.   At 15, he made his first professional appearance, on a PaulWhiteman show, and he first saw, walking down the street, theredhead who's still his wife and the mother of his three daughters.   Five years later, Dion and the Belmonts had their first Top 10record, ``A Teenager in Love.''   This year, Dion, who wears a jaunty Bronx taxi driver's cap evenat home in Boca Raton, Fla., has a new rock 'n' roll album, ``YoFrankie,'' which is getting good reviews. He wrote most of thesongs.   Dion, who turns 50 on July 18, was inducted into the Rock 'n'Roll Hall of Fame in January.   Some of his generation became tuxedoed nightclub singers.   ``I'm a die-hard,'' Dion says. ``I've always been a rock 'n'roll enthusiast. In case I lose my job as a rock 'n' roll singer,I'll drive a cab. I've got my cabbie cap. But I've been fortunate.I always paid the rent. I've never done another job. Never.''   Dion isn't buying any ``don't trust anybody over 30'' stuff orpronouncements by Mick Jagger and Peter Townshend of the Who aboutnot wanting to be geriatric rockers.   ``When I started there was no rock 'n' roll, no expectations, norules,'' Dion says. ``Some people got the idea that rock 'n' rollwas just for the young. Today we know that's not so. You could bean old fogey at 19. You can be kicking up your heels at 63. It's anattitude.   ``Rock at its best lifts your spirit, keeps you aware, makes youfeel and think, keeps you young.   ``If you start with the anger and a sound to get the girls, andkeep on, you find out it's really an artistic expression. You canshare your thoughts. This is powerful.''   Rock 'n' roll may have moved through doo-wop, British invasionsand disco to post-punk, but for Dion it hasn't changed much.   ``The only thing that has changed is the equipment,'' he says.``Basically, you've got a backbeat, electric guitars and it's dancemusic.   ``This new album is an '80s album. But it has elements of mymusic. It's black music filtered through an Italian neighborhood.You come out with an attitude.   ``I always used a bunch of guys to imitate a horn section,because I couldn't afford a horn section. I became kind ofidentified with that sound _ `Ruby Baby,' `Runaround Sue.' I use itall through this album.   ``When I was growing up we used to bang on cardboard boxes and Ihad a guitar and a bunch of guys would sing. You put a drum to thatand you go. With all the technology today it comes out with morepower and clarity.''   After doo-wop faded and Dion conquered a drug problem, he becamea folk singer. He had a hit with ``Abraham, Martin and John.''   ``I wasn't striking lightning in the sky,'' he says. ``That songgave me a chance to sit in coffeehouses which were flourishingaround the country and play acoustic guitar and express myself.   ``Those times were wonderful for me. For the first time itbecame a two-way street, the audience and me. When I started out,we used to run out at the Brooklyn Fox and do two songs. Then FatsDomino would do two songs. Jerry Lee Lewis would do two.   ``In 1980 I got into gospel music. It was a way to express whatwas inside me. I made five gospel albums. I don't call it religiousmusic. I don't look at myself as religious.''   Dion, a solo singer since 1960, had a reunion concert with theBelmonts in 1972 but has stayed off rock revival tours. ``I feellike I would dry up if I did that.   ``But I love doing the old songs. Those songs become morevaluable to me every year. I love to see the joy `The Wanderer' and`Runaround Sue' bring to people. When Arista Records wanted me todo an album, I said I'd do it if I can do a rock 'n' roll album inthe tradition of those two songs, meaning get into some strongcharacters.''   Dion says he got a lot of help on his new album. Paul Simonsings on ``Written on the Subway Wall'' and he's in the video. ``Wedid it on a subway platform in the middle of the night,'' Dionsays. ``We had about 15 cops, 20 Guardian Angels. It was great. Wehad dinner served down there.   ``I had Paul sing one of my favorite doo-wop songs, `LittleStar,' done by the Elegants, in the middle of `Subway Wall.'   ``One of my friends had a bunch of 8mm film of us from the olddays. It's woven through the whole video. The end shows me in myfirst car, which I bought for $75.''   Personally, Dion says, ``I'm kind of an oddball. I've got thesame wife I started off with. We grew up together. We love eachother. The real thing that kept us going is that we accepted eachother at our worst. We walked through the valley. I was with her ather lowest and she was with me at my lowest.   ``We've got three great daughters. They're a joy. I'm blessed.''   Dion is looking forward to his 50th birthday party.   ``It's going to be a bash,'' he says. ``There'll be a lot offriends with instruments. I probably will get into the mood toplay.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ira Levin, a novelist and playwright whosethrillers and mysteries have spiced the stage and bookstores foryears, notes wistfully that ``comedy comes easiest.''   But book editors ask for thrillers, not comedies, Levin says.   ``I always have to watch myself,'' he says. Very often when I'mwriting scary stuff, I find I can't resist a little joke. Ieventually edit it out. Sometimes I'll write a good one down andhope a place will show up for it. It rarely does. A joke usuallysprings out of the situation and characters.''   His current off-Broadway offering is ``Cantorial,'' in which theaudience never sees the cantor. They only hear him singing, asinging ghost.   Not a new twist for Levin, who has written about thesupernatural before. But unlike his best-known novel, ``Rosemary'sBaby,'' this play's ghost is benign. All he does is sing. But hissongs are directed to a young couple that has taken up residence ina former Manhattan synagogue. The ghostly voice wants theirfurniture out of the living room. He wants it to be a synagogueagain.   Levin's other novels include ``A Kiss Before Dying,'' ``TheStepford Wives'' and ``The Boys from Brazil.'' His plays range fromthe comedy ``No Time for Sergeants'' in 1955 to ``Deathtrap'' in1978, Broadway's longest-running thriller.   ``For a while I would go back and forth between a play and abook,'' Levin says. ``At this point, I'd like to do more books.It's hard to get a play on. It takes so long. It was easier in theold days.''   ``Cantorial'' was presented three years ago in Stamford, Conn.``There were problems with it,'' Levin says. ``I put it on theshelf. Then I did a complete rewrite. I felt I had found theproblems with it so it was kind of exciting to get it right.''   He doesn't mind that it's being presented off-Broadway insteadof on and is pleased at its success there. ``We're hoping it'sgoing to have a good, long, healthy run. So far it is doing verynicely. The audience seems to be building, from word-of-mouth.''   Levin doesn't want potential playgoers to think ``Cantorial,''with the young man in it adopted and thinking he may be Jewish, isonly for Jews. ``I think non-Jewish people seem to respond to it,if anything, more warmly than Jewish audience members. Partly, Ithink they're relieved they've enjoyed it.   ``I always intended it for a mainstream audience. We all arelooking for roots and family warmth, even those of us who've hadit. It's nice to have that sense of recapturing it.''   Levin plunged into writing full time after New York University,where he majored in English. A TV script he wrote for a competitionwas bought by NBC.   ``That was enough to encourage my parents to let me stay homeand write,'' he says. ``I wrote a few more TV plays that sold. Iwrote a few that didn't. I wrote my first book, `A Kiss BeforeDying,' then I went out looking for work. Before I could find a jobthe book had been accepted by Simon and Schuster, so I officiallybecame a writer. I've never held an honest job.   ``That's unless you count two years in the Army. Even there Imanaged to write training films.''   Levin, who is divorced and has three grown sons, lives in aManhattan apartment with a grand piano and a big, black coffeetable with a big black box in the center. It's a TV projector for a10-foot screen which pulls down from the ceiling. Consequently hedoesn't read much anymore.   ``The architect who did the apartment talked me into it. I'vegot my own movie theater, which I always wanted as a child. I'vereally gotten hooked on TV. It has even made a baseball fan of me,which I never was.'' The study where he writes is partitioned fromthe living room by a wall of glass bricks.   ``I tend to be a workaholic,'' he says. ``When I really get intosomething, I wake up earlier and earlier and work later and later.After a few days I can't tell the fictional world from the realworld.''   Years ago, Levin made a list of interesting settings for novelsor plays. A haunted synagogue was on the list.   ``One day it dawned on me it should be haunted by a cantor, notsomebody banging around in chains,'' he says. ``I thought cantorialsinging would be interesting; it's unusual to hear in a theater.That's how I got started. Then the synagogue became a formersynagogue. The singing obviously made it a play instead of anovel.''   ```The Boys from Brazil' was always a novel idea because theseboys would have to be cropping up in different countries.''   Levin never has written a screenplay. ``Any idea I got could bea play or a novel first,'' he says. ``I might as well do it thatway and please myself rather than write a screenplay that has toplease 100 people on the coast.   ``I was going to do `Deathtrap,' then the thought of writing thewhole thing over again got to be a chore. I was sorry afterward. Iwasn't that happy with the screenplay that was done.''   But he liked ``Rosemary's Baby.''   ``It's probably the most faithful movie adaptation that has everbeen made,'' he says. ``Roman Polanski directed it and wrote thescreenplay. It was the first movie he'd made that wasn't based onhis own original material. I don't think he knew he had a right tochange things.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ray Charles meet Charles Wadsworth, CharlesWadsworth meet Ray Charles. That may be the scenario one Fridaynight in May when these two accomplished pianists meet backstage atthe New York City Ballet.   It is a bit of stage irony that these two remarkable musicianswere both born in Georgia about a year apart, both trod the boardsfor 40 years or more fashioning stellar careers, and yet theirpaths never crossed. Until now.   In the same week in May, Ray Charles and Charles Wadsworth willbe featured in ``Live from Lincoln Center'' broadcasts on PBS,playing two separate programs of music in their separate,inimitable styles.   Ray Charles, at home in Los Angeles, plans to turn on TV today(May 7), at 5 p.m. (EDT) for a two-hour concert by the ChamberMusic Society of Lincoln Center. Charles Wadsworth will play andmake a speech ``summing up 20 years of incredibly intense, hard,much-loved work.''   Wadsworth has been artistic director of the society since itsbeginning and has seen it grow from 16 concerts a season to 90. Hedecided to retire at the end of this season, when the society was20 and he would be turning 60.   Wadsworth plans to take his wife to a birthday dinner nextFriday, and then to the New York State Theater to see three balletsby the New York City Ballet. The middle, 50-minute one, at 9 p.m.(EDT), will be televised. It will have Ray Charles on stage withthe dancers, playing piano and singing his songs. ``A Fool forYou,'' a 1955 Ray Charles composition, is also the title of theballet.   Then Charles Wadsworth may go backstage to meet Ray Charles.   Ray Charles, who was born in Albany, Ga., on Sept. 23, 1930,studied classical music at the State School for the Blind in St.Augustine, Ga., long before he became famous for his exhilaratingcombination of secularized gospel, blues and pop music.   Charles Wadsworth, born in Newman, Ga., on May 21, 1929, wasfirst primarily a piano accompanist. He has been working inclassical chamber music since Gian Carlo Menotti had him set updaily chamber concerts at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1960.   Wadsworth has written some pop ballads and intends to use timeafforded by retirement to write some more, as well as play thepiano more often and possibly do something on cable TV.   For the ballet, Ray Charles says, ``Choreographer Peter Martinswas the cat who picked some of my early recordings. I had to goback and learn the songs the way I did them at that time. They tookthe records and that's what they learned the steps to. I play someof those songs today but I play them so different.''   Charles was happy with the songs that were chosen. ``I've beenvery fortunate in my recording career,'' he says. ``I never was putin a position to record anything I didn't like. Record companiesalways said, `Hey, man, whatever you record, you record.'''   The first performance of ``A Fool for You'' was last spring,during the New York City Ballet's American Music Festival. Charles,who never had provided a live ballet score before, didn't getcarried away and stretch out on any of the numbers. ``I'm not goingto do something to goof them up,'' he says.   On stage with him on Friday, as they were for last year'spremiere, will be his backup singers, the Raeletts, and most of themembers of his first band. ``They wanted it as close to the samesound as possible,'' he says. ``I went out and found the cats. Theyall have their own things going now. They come in and do this justfor me, which I think is sweet.''   Today's chamber music concert will include Poulenc's ``Sextetfor Piano and Winds,'' one of pianist Wadsworth's favorites. ``I'vebeen playing that 30 years now,'' he says. ``It's a very cheerful,sensuous, warm piece. It seemed the ideal thing for me to play inthis final concert.''   Asked what he considers the Chamber Music Society of LincolnCenter's greatest achievement, Wadsworth replies, ``I think it hasbeen to focus people all around the country on the incrediblewealth of chamber music repertoire and the excitement that can begenerated by having the very greatest virtuoso artists perform thismusic together.   ``There are so many more chamber music events around the countrythan we ever dreamed would be happening when we started thisthing.''   Of the two, Ray Charles was first on television, in Seattle in1948. ``My trio had this 15-minute radio show every week,'' herecalls. ``They came in and filmed part of it. We didn't doanything great on it but I was playing my music and getting itexposed. I was extremely excited; I was beside myself. TV wasn'tbig then. Bars had one TV and people would meet up there andwatch.''   These days, Charles turns down more TV than he accepts. Heprefers to tour with a band and the Raeletts and to perform withorchestras in symphonic arrangements of his music.   Thinking about hearing Charles perform for ballet, Wadsworthsays, ``I've always had the greatest admiration for my fellowGeorgian. I can't wait.''   On the other side, Charles says that he likes chamber music``when it is played right. I have to tell you I like any kind ofmusic I can sit down and listen to and it makes sense.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ruth Brown is getting ahead by going backward.   She became a recording star singing rhythm 'n' blues in the1950s. Now she's on Broadway singing jazz and blues dating fro thethree decades before that.   And it works. She's teamed with Linda Hopkins and Carrie Smith inthe revue ``Black and Blue,'' a celebration of songs from the '20s,'30s and '40s. It opens on Broadway tonight (Jan. 15) at theMinskoff Theater, not just the three singers, but tap dancers andwell-known jazz musicians in the band.   When ``Black and Blue'' opened in Paris in 1985, it ran for eightmonths and Vogue magazine called it, ``The coolest thing in Paris... a red-hot revival of black American music.''   In the 1950s, Miss Brown was Atlantic Records' most-recordedperformer. She pumped out some 87 rhythm 'n' blues releases and somecalled Atlantic ``the House that Ruth Built.''   She admits that, at her ``Black and Blue'' audition, ``I was alittle hesitant, to tell the truth. I'd been singing rhythm 'n'blues. I had not experienced that whole Cotton Club scene; that'swhat the general idea was based on.   ``We went to Paris shortly after the movie `The Cotton Club' hadbeen a good hit in Paris.''   But now, harkening back to some of the fine old hits of anearlier golden age of cabarets and Broadway revues, she is not onlycomfortable, she promises new success.   If ``Black and Blue's'' three singers are patterned afteranybody, she says, it is the Peters Sisters, a trio of Americansisters who became a hit in Europe. ``The last one, Virginia Peters,is living in Paris. She saw the show and said she was pleased. Itwas reminiscent of her good times.''   Miss Brown had three solos in Paris and she still does, but``Mood Indigo'' has been replaced by ``Body and Soul.'' Singingthose songs she says, ``was really like going back to my beginning.''   She was born Ruth Weston on Jan. 12, 1928, in Portsmouth, Va.,the oldest of seven children whose father was a Methodist choirdirector.   At 16, she joined Lucky Millinder's band.   Traveling with Millinder, she says, ``I was keeping company withone of the fellows in the band. Unless I wanted to be buried when Igot home, I thought I better get married. That's how I got Brown.''   By the time she got to Washington, she and trumpeter Jimmy Brownwere separated and Millinder fired her for fetching drinks for themusicians.   She had left home against her father's wishes and found herselfwithout the price of a bus ticket home, ``standing on a streetcorner by the Howard Theater with my suitcase in my hand, 225 milesfrom home.   ``A young man walked up I recognized; he was a singer with HoraceHeidt. He took me to the Crystal Caverns and introduced me toBlanche Calloway. She gave me a chance to sing for her audience.They received me in such a way she said she'd put me to work for aweek.   ``Blanche was Cab Calloway's sister. She was one of the firstfemale band leaders and one of the most gorgeous women ever to gracethe stage. This show would have been her cup of tea.''   Blanche Calloway became her manager. Miss Brown says, ``Shecalled the son of the Turkish ambassador who was starting a recordcompany and suggested he get down and listen to this girl.'' AhmetErtegun listened and Ruth Brown was signed to the fledgling AtlanticRecords in 1949.   Miss Brown's first recording at Atlantic Records was a ballad,``So Long.'' Then staff writer Rudy Toombs brought in a fast song,``Teardrops from My Eyes,'' which she also recorded for Atlantic.   ``It took,'' she says. ``It was the first thing I'd done with aback beat. It was really danceable. It went into the charts at 3 or4, moved into No. 1 and stayed about 27 weeks.''   She says that the song of hers people remember best is ``Mama, HeTreats Your Daughter Mean.''   ``No matter where I go, 35 years later they ask for that song.''   Other big records were ``5-10-15 Hours (of Your Love),'' ``OhWhat a Dream,'' ``Mambo Baby'' and ``Lucky Lips,'' which moved fromthe rhythm 'n' blues best-selling charts to the pop charts, unusualin those days.   It wasn't always sunshine. She has had to get 9-to-5 jobs fromtime to time and dropped out of show business to raise her children.   Record royalties stopped until, in 1985, attorney Howell Begle, arhythm 'n' blues fan, began to look into her case, and others.   Now she gets monthly statements and has received one lump sumpayment going back to 1970. ``I'm satisfied,'' she says. ``A lot ofpeople have been helped, even at this late stage of the game. Ahmetmade the decision to let us go ahead amicably. He could have causedus to stay in court a long time and most of us didn't have the moneyto do that.''   Last season Miss Brown was off-Broadway in the musical,``Staggerlee.'' A casting director saw that and invited her to readfor Motormouth Mabel in the film ``Hairspray.'' She got the part. InDecember she was featured in a PBS documentary, ``That Rhythm, ThoseBlues.''   She has been married four times. ``I have two fine sons. They'reactors in California, waiting for the big moment they're going toget their star on the sidewalk.'' Her grandson recently appeared ina McDonald's commercial as a future Olympics long-distance runner.   ``I've been more active in the last year and a half than ever,''she says. ``I've been back doing nightclubs and I went to a jazzfestival in Japan. I've really got the bug for acting. FantasyRecords put out `Have a Good Time,' cut live in Los Angeles. I'vegot the feeling, as the old folks say, I'm on a roll.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY CAMPBELL</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There may be some Scots who can't bear thebagpipe, but it's a rare Russian who bad-mouths the balalaika.   ``The balalaika is the instrument most close to the Russiansoul,'' says Sergei Lukin, one of the 82 members of the OsipovBalalaika Orchestra, which is on a tour of 40 American citiesthrough March 9. ``It is very tender, very touching. It startssinging in the hands of a real master.''   What's a balalaika? Well, it's a stringed instrument somewhatlike a guiter, but is triangular shaped, usually has only threestrings, and comes in a variety of sizes.   Americans may remember the sound from ``Lara's Theme,'' on thesound track of the film ``Dr. Zhivago.''   Lukin plays the domra, which looks like a round-bodied banjo, itsflat front the size of a dinner plate. Many balalaikas sound best,apparently, mixed with complimentary instruments such as the domra.   Lukin and other members of the Osipov, the Soviet Union's topbalalaika orchestra, were interviewed through an interpreter.   ``We're doing all kinds of songs _ sad and merry. They all depictthe state of a soul,'' says Nikolai Kalinin, the orchestra'sconductor and artistic director.   ``There are really rhythmic, energetic songs. You want to dancewhen you hear them,'' adds singer Nadja Babkina, founder of theBabkina Folk Ensemble, which is on tour with the orchestra.   Miss Babkina, who wears her long hair dramatically forward overone shoulder, says that in the 16th century, balalaika players weredispersed and their instruments were burned because they werethought to be diverting people's attention from the church.   ``That's why a law was signed by our czar that all these groupsof amateur artists should be destroyed and the instruments also,''she says. ``Russian people tried to hide these instruments. In the18th century someone said it was time to renew them.''   ``Why don't you ask how to play it?'' asks Alexander Gorbachev,41, holding his wooden balalaika that was made in 1910 by a mannamed Nalimov, the Stradivarius of balalaika makers.   Then he demonstrates, drawing his right index finger across thestrings like a violin bow.   ``It is such a strong finger, he can even open a bottle,'' saysSergei Butushin, who plays an array of horns that he has made, somewith bells made of cows' horns.   ``I go to a place where they kill cows and take quickly theirhorns,'' Butushin says. ``We have several such places in Moscow.''   The balalaika, used mainly for playing folk music, is morepopular in rural areas, but it is not unknown in the cities.   Vladimir Byeloblotsky, 38, playing some jazz riffs on his bassbalalaika, says he was born in Moscow and heard the balalaika as achild.   ``I started playing contrabass, like in the symphony orchestra,''he says. ``Then I was very fond of jazz and I played in a jazzorchestra which went away from the Soviet Union and now is in theUnited States. Now I'm playing this bass balalaika and I'm reallyvery happy. I think that is the thing I wanted to do.''   Gorbachev, who plays ``prima balalaika,'' the main one of thefive sizes of balalaikas in the Osipov orchestra, started on theaccordion, like his father.   ``I joined music school when I was 15 years old,'' Gorbachevsays. ``I heard balalaika and I liked very much the sound and Istarted seriously studying this instrument. I was born in Moscow butmy relatives came from villages.''   Conductor Kalinin explains that orchestra members and aspiringmembers alike must audition each year. Seniority doesn't count. ``Ifsomebody proves not so good, he retires,'' he says.   Accordion player Igor Konovalov says, ``I was born in 1941, whenthe Germans were very close to Moscow in the Second World War. Mymother went to a village and I was born with an accordion in myhands. At that time, in villages, it was the most popularinstrument. At night, people came out of their homes and sat onbenches and started playing.   ``I started playing the gormoyan, which is a purely Russianaccordion, when I was 12.''   Kalinin, 45, the orchestra conductor for 10 years, was once aprofessional singer. His wife plays domra in the orchestra. Theyoungest of their three children, now 5, waved his hands like aconductor _ ``by a kind of inheritance,'' his father says _ beforehe could talk.   Butushin, whose interest in horns crowded out his earlierbalalaika playing, has been in the orchestra for 20 years, since hewas 15, and has been on all its American tours _ in 1969, '71 and'77.   Lukin, 31, started out playing the cello as a boy in music school.   ``I was so small and the cello was so big and heavy, I thought itwas better if I played this domra,'' he says. ``Since then I deeplylove this instrument.''   ``This domra player is the best in the Soviet Union,'' Kalininsays. ``He's concert master in the orchestra. He treats his domralike a beloved woman.''   Lukin's wife also plays domra in the Osipov orchestra and in theAmerican concerts they play a duet, which they encore with a ScottJoplin rag.   The Osipov Balalaika Orchestra is the Soviet Union's biggest andbest, conductor Kalinin says.   ``It was founded by Vassily Andreyev in 1919, consisting of eightplayers.'' Kalinin says. ``He dressed the balalaika in a tuxedo.''   Conductor Nikolai Petrovich Osipov later added other instrumentsand commissioned composers.

But if you are a Soviet artist,dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov notwithstanding, it isn't easy.   Nina Beilina, winner in three violin competitions and acclaimedfor her playing in the Soviet Union, gave a recital in December atLincoln Center that was favorably received.   But she's been at it in New York for a dozen years and only nowdoes she feel her career is in the ascendancy.   She has managed to make ends meet, mainly by touring in Europe,South America and South Africa. She also teaches, though previouslywith a sinking feeling that her career was going nowhere. Lookingback, she knows that she made mistakes.   In the Soviet Union, artists are more protected. A state agencybooks their performances, keeps them at work.   But Soviet artists, newly arrived in America, may find theirreputations unknown. Then they have to find a booking agency andmake decisions without family, friends or trusted advisers. Add tothat an unfamiliar language and culture shock.   ``It was just an incredible battle for a woman alone,'' shesays. ``I came with only a library collected by me and my husband _books and music scores. I feel if I play well, that's all it takes.Of course it's not enough.''   When despair threatened, music saved her. She practiced Bach.   ``It was my refuge. Bach for me is like a priest to whom I goand talk. Just to touch the music is such happiness for me.''   It's through Bach that her career is now building.   ``A woman who runs the free concerts at the Cathedral of St.John the Divine heard me play,'' she says. ``She said I play Bach aspecial way and I should make a festival from January through Maylast year. From my students I created an orchestra. I conducted. Myson played the double violin things with me. In six concerts, wehad 15,000 people.   ``I played all that Bach wrote for violin. It was my husband'swish. In Russia I did part of this, with harpsichord and organ.Here I had a chance to do even more.''   This year, Miss Beilina was asked to organize four Bach concertsat another church. She was invited to establish a Bach festivalnear Rome June 8-15, taking 15 musicians with her. After that, sheand her violinist son performed at a baroque festival in Italy. The15-member group will tour in South America for a month startingAug. 20.   In April she played the Shostakovich violin sonata with Sovietcomposer Boris Tischenko at New York University. ``It's withoutmoney,'' she says, ``but I feel very good. You cannot live yourlife only for how much money you earn. To play with a good pianistwho understands Shostakovich is very dear to me. It could happenthat he would write something for me.''   In the Soviet Union, after she married conductor IsraelChuydnovsky, the authorities based him in Leningrad and her inMoscow. They commuted to be together.   Even when she was traveling, pregnant with Emile, now asophomore on scholarship at Yale studying violin, Miss Beilinarecalls those days as her happiest.   Fond of the idea of Disneyland, they nicknamed their son Mickey.Before Mickey was 2, his father died of cancer. Miss Beilina'sSoviet concerts thereafter were in towns, not cities. Her touringwas restricted to South America and Eastern Europe. In 1976, whenMickey was 6, she applied, successfully, to emigrate.   In Rome they shared an apartment with another family. After aday doing laundry by hand in cold water because she had no moneyfor hot, she ran into a friend of her husband's. He introduced herto a priest who moved mother and son into their own apartment andrerouted her from her intended destination, Canada, to New York.   In New York she chose not to join an enclave of Soviet emigresin Queens. She moved into a then-new apartment house for artists inManhattan, with rent one-third of income, where she still lives.   ``It was great luck to be accepted in this building,'' she says.``The apartment was empty. We had just books in big containers. Weslept on a rug. When he was asleep, I was crying. When he wasawake, I tried to be cheerful.	
</TEXT><NOTE>By MARY FOSTER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PASS CHRISTIAN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's enough to make a Cajun drool.   Robert Hunt has millions of pounds of redfish. He has babyredfish and 40-year-old monsters, and all sizes in between.   Down a sandy road, a couple of miles from the beach, Hunt hasredfish growing so fast in 31 acres of ponds and tanks that hethinks they'll take less than two years to go from tiny fingerlingsto three pounds or better _ ready for cooking.   Hunt is one of several entrepreneurs who hope to save the Cajundelicacy _ even the redfish itself _ from extinction.   It all started when Louisiana Chef Paul Prudhomme flipped aredfish into a white-hot iron skillet and charred it in deep spices,setting off a national craze for blackened redfish.   ``Mr. Prudhomme did a very good job,'' says Ted Brennan ofBrennan's Restaurant in the New Orleans' French Quarter. ``Blackenedredfish has become part of the restaurant folklore in New Orleans,along with oysters Rockefeller and bananas Foster. People from allover the country want it.   ``It's not just in New Orleans that people demanded it. It wouldbe hard to go into any major city in the country and not findblackened redfish on a menu somewhere.''   Prudhomme says he doesn't understand; blackened tuna would bejust as good.   Indeed, when the demand for redfish grew great enough to threatenthe very existence of the species, New Orleans restaurants changedthe menu to feature other blackened fish, especially other membersof the drum family.   Last year, the state of Louisiana, alarmed by the depletion ofredfish in the Gulf of Mexico, stopped all commercial fishingthrough 1991 and banned the sale of redfish caught off Louisianauntil 1992.   Conservation officials said the redfish catch, estimated at54,000 pounds in 1980, jumped to 5.4 million pounds in 1986 as theCajun craze spread. Facing predictions that the catch could hit 20millions pounds annually, concerned federal conservationists steppedin and state officials followed suit, virtually stopping fishing forred drum in the Gulf.   After the shutdown, demand for the fish grew so that anunderground market developed, leading to arrests at the kitchendoors of some of New Orleans' classiest restaurants.   With that kind of market, men like Hunt thought it would be worththe effort to find a way to farm redfish _ unique problemsnotwithstanding. After all, catfish farming has become commonplacein Louisiana and Misssissippi ponds.   But redfish are saltwater creatures that thrive in wide-rangingenvironments, running from spawning grounds in the Louisiana marshesto far out in the Gulf. How do you pen up game fish and coax them tolive and breed in captivity?   Hunt had one idea. He set up set stainless steel tanks at PassChristian, not far from the Louisiana state line. Other farmers aretrying submerged cages and blocked-off canals in the Louisiana marsh.   At his Redfish Hatchery Inc., Hunt has created a perpetual springfor about a dozen fish. They mate regularly in the dim waters ofthree spawning tanks.   When the fingerlings reach a certain size they are transferred toponds, which have pure oxygen pumped into them.   Hunt says the technique he worked out can produce marketableredfish rapidly.   ``By loading the water with oxygen we can practically watch theredfish grow,'' he says.   He predicts the ponds will produce over a million pounds ofredfish a year, averaging three to five pounds each.   Hunt says the one-acre ponds cost about $25,000 to build, notincluding the costs of a well to supply the water. But there is apotential for profit. When sales stopped, redfish fillets wereselling at $5.35 a pound in New Orleans seafood markets.   Although redfish will survive in full-strength sea water orbarely salty water, some salinity is needed, and the closer the fishfarm is to sea water, the fewer problems growers experience.   In St. Mary Parish, the salt comes from a pool atop a salt dome.Sugar cane farmer Walter Landry turned 25 acres into a redfish pondby drilling a well at the dome and mixing that with fresh water toproduce the equivalent of sea water.   Landry hopes to market redfish from the pond every 22 months,with his first crop due in midsummer.   Another group of investors is raising redfish in abandoned oilcanals in the South Louisiana marsh. They are betting that the fishwill thrive in natural conditions.   Efforts to grow a marketable product include blocking off theends of dead-end canals and filling them with fingerlings, andraising the small fish in cages.   ``We have about 55,000 fish in the water in eight cages,'' saysGary Lee of Mariculture Enterprises Inc.   Lee says his group has invested $250,000 and a lot of sweat inthe venture, but expects to see a profit in the long run.   ``We should have fish ready to see by the fall,'' he says.``It'll be three years until we see any profit, but long-range, weexpect it to pay off.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the basement of the student union buildingat Duke University, a nervous Ellen Simon fidgeted in the last rowof a small, dark studio theater.   She sat as far away as possible from her father, playwright NeilSimon, and her former stepmother, actress Marsha Mason. They were atDuke, along with her younger sister, Nancy, to attend the worldpremiere of ``Moon and Valentino,'' the first play by the31-year-old Miss Simon to make it to the stage.   Throughout the evening, Miss Mason leaned forward, hanging on toeach word of dialogue. Simon kept taking off his glasses and wipinghis eyes. When the play was over and the hearty applause diminished,the four embraced in the tiny theater's cramped aisle.   ``It was a special joy, that first experience, listening to theplay on stage,'' Simon said the next day. ``Now we can be moreobjective about it.''   ``Moonlight and Valentino'' is personal, even painful, but likeher famous father's plays, it also is filled with laughter. And likeSimon's ``Chapter Two'' and his ``Brighton Beach'' trilogy, itechoes the playwright's own life.   The play concerns a young woman whose husband is killed in anautomobile accident and how she copes with his death. Miss Simon'shusband, Jeffrey Bishop, an astrophysicist, died in November 1987when he was struck by a car while out jogging.   For Miss Simon, ``Moonlight and Valentino'' goes beyond her ownexperience.   ``I feel that the personal aspect is limited to the fact that Iknow what it's like to go through intense grief, to go through ajarring, sudden loss and to be left, all of a sudden, with anenormous mountain to climb and not knowing whether you are going tomake it,'' she said.   ``The fact is that I did find myself at the bottom of themountain, did climb it somehow, bolstered by friends, family and myson, Andrew. I got up there and was changed, by not running awayfrom the grief but by experiencing it. That's what made me want towrite it.''   Miss Simon, who had her own dance troupe and worked as achoreographer, has always been a writer, turning out short storiesand even starting a novel at age 15. That was the year her mother,Simon's first wife, Joan, died of cancer. She wrote another play anda screenplay before attempting ``Moonlight and Valentino.'' Neitherwas any good, she says.   But her father and Emanuel Azenberg, who produces Simon's playson Broadway, encouraged her to continue.   ``Bigger,'' counseled Azenberg. ``Write something bigger.''   Simon was more cautious about his daughter's writing career.   ``I think my father was frightened the first time I showed him ascript,'' Miss Simon said. ``What if it wasn't good? What was hegoing to say to me? But he read it and, I think, was relieved. Thenhe gave me a lot of criticism.''   Both the screenplay and that first play remain in her bottomdrawer, unproduced.   Not so with ``Moonlight and Valentino.'' The play was given areading last July in New York. Azenberg brought it to Duke, where heteaches a course in the school's drama program, for a two-weekworkshop production in February. Further development is possible,probably at Stages Repertory Theater in Houston later this year.When it will come to New York, no one is sure.   ``Once I knew why I wanted to write it, which was to talk abouttransformation and if pain comes to you, don't avoid it, almostembrace it because there is an opportunity there,'' Miss Simon says.``Once I established what I wanted to say, the characters came notso much from my life but from the need to create conflict within theplay.''   Miss Simon's heroine, Rebecca, is comforted in her grief by achain-smoking sister, a dizzy best girlfriend whose marriage isfalling apart, and an acerbic ex-stepmother who still cares for herformer husband's children.   ``I knew `Moonlight and Valentino' couldn't be one woman'sjourney,'' Miss Simon says. ``I knew it had to be four women'sjourneys, bring them to a point of realization in their own lives.There's a line in the play about the house attracting `widows of allsorts.' That's what I wanted to write about.''   The play also has one male character _ a handsome house painternicknamed `Valentino' by the women. Although he has no lines, thepainter is an important part of the play. He's a symbol of thepossibility of a new life, a rebuilding after tragedy.   Miss Simon began writing ``Moonlight and Valentino'' four monthsafter her husband's death. She finished the first draft in 19 days.   ``I never let it alone,'' she says. ``I spent 10 hours a day onit.''   From March until November of last year, Miss Simon plowed throughnine full rewrites, something her father is famous for doing.   ``The only thing I think she may have gotten from me is theattitude toward the work,'' says Simon, who has had nearly two dozenplays and musicals produced on Broadway. His latest comedy,``Rumors,'' has settled in for a long run at the Broadhurst Theater.   Before the first performance, Simon told his daughter, ``I have anote pad and I'm going to take notes.''   ``He came up to me afterward and said, `Here are my notes,'''Miss Simon recalls. ``It was a blank pad.''   Now the father ponders how his reputation will affect hers.   ``She'll have to deal with it,'' he says. ``It's unfortunate, butit goes with the territory. She has no obligation to be the daughterof Neil Simon. It's a hindrance to have attention taken away fromwhat her work is. She doesn't deserve that, and I don't think itwill happen once people see the play.   ``I think she's going to write more plays,'' he adds.   ``This is not going to be a one-shot playwright. She's just toogood. There's so much in her.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The quiet, ivy-covered campus at DukeUniversity seems a long way from Times Square, but it has become ahot spot for producers testing shows on their way to Broadway.   ``What you have is a New Haven-Boston-Philadelphia-Washingtontryout in Durham,'' says Emanuel Azenberg, the New York producer whofirst started the migration south in 1986.   The 55-year-old Azenberg is a pragmatic, plain-spoken veteran ofthe Broadway theater. He has presented every Neil Simon play onBroadway since 1972. He's also a co-producer of ``Jerome Robbins'Broadway,'' this season's newest hit and the biggest box-officebonanza since ``The Phantom of the Opera.''   Azenberg discovered Duke through his family. His daughter went toschool there. During a visit, Azenberg saw a theater in the studentunion building and fell in love with it.   ``This is what all of New York should have _ beautiful 640-seattheaters to do plays,'' he says. Through the efforts of then-dramahead John Clum and a handshake agreement with Joel Fleishman, asenior vice president at the university, the producer brought EugeneO'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' starring Jack Lemmon toNorth Carolina.   When Azenberg takes a show to Duke, everybody _ from actors tostagehands _works for minimum salary, and authors forego royalties.Students get to work behind the scenes with professionals oneverything from props to sets to publicity.   Since ``Long Day's Journey,'' Azenberg has done Neil Simon's``Broadway Bound'' and Jason Robards in ``A Month of Sundays'' atDuke. Now other producers have noticed the campus, too.   ``They have picked up on the idea that it makes sense _artistically, financially, theatrically,'' Azenberg says. ``You'rebringing something to a new area and the audiences respond.''   Lucille Lortel took ``A Walk in the Woods,'' Lee Blessing'stwo-character play about American and Soviet arms controlnegotiators, to Duke. In February, dance superstar MikhailBaryshnikov played three sold-out weeks in an adaptation of FranzKakfa's ``Metamorphosis'' before coming to New York.   ``Producers can do their thing in a very relaxed, non-pressuresituation,'' says Ron Kumin, administrative director of the Dukedrama program.   And they get intelligent, aware and responsive audiences,according to Kumin. Durham is one point in the Research Triangle, anarea that also includes Raleigh and Chapel Hill and its large numberof schools and universities. The triangle has the highest per capitapopulation of Ph.D. engineers and scientists in the country.   Duke is a wealthy, conservative school, built on the tobaccofortune of James Buchanan Duke. The school, according to one collegeguide, likes to think of itself as ``the Harvard of the South,'' andits academic credentials are impressive with first-rate engineering,business and medical schools.   Now the drama program _ it isn't a department yet _ has decidedto try for a higher visibility. The program is headed by David Ball,formerly of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.   Ball, who arrived in 1985, currently supervises 35 students and afaculty of 12 instructors, including Azenberg who teaches a theaterappreciation course. His reading list includes Tom Stoppard's ``TheReal Thing,'' Simon's ``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' and Athol Fugard's``Master Harold...and the boys,'' all of them, not coincidentally,produced on Broadway by Azenberg.   Because of the Broadway tryout situation, students andprofessionals learn from each other, Ball says.   ``We had a session with four actresses who were in the cast andunderstudied roles in `A Month of Sundays,''' he recalls. ``Theytalked to our senior students which that year included seven womenand one guy. What was supposed to be a 45-minute discussion aboutthe roles of women in theater, went on for five hours.''   Ball also decided to take the tryout program one step further.Besides serving as a testing ground for new Broadway shows, Dukewould be used as an incubator for new plays by unknown authors andstarring unknown actors.   The first new play produced under this program was ``Moonlightand Valentino'' by Ellen Simon, daughter of Neil Simon. It had itsworld premiere in February in a tiny performance space in thebasement of the student union building.   ``The fact that it's Neil Simon's daughter has something to dowith it and nothing to do with it,'' Azenberg says. ``It is a goodplay. Now we've taken the money generated out of certain endowmentsthat we've helped arrange and are using it for new playwrights.''   Money for those endowment funds is being raised through benefitperformances for Duke alumni of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' in NewYork, ``Les Miserables'' in Chicago and ``The Phantom of the Opera''in Los Angeles.   More than 40 students worked on ``Metamorphosis'' and ``Moonlightand Valentino'' during their performances at Duke. ``Moonlight,''according to Azenberg, will have another life somewhere in regionaltheater before he decides whether to bring it to New York.   The play already has made its mark on the Duke students who wereinvolved in its production, and students were more involved in itthan ``Metamorphosis,'' which arrived with a complete New Yorkproduction team.   ``The stage manager of `Moonlight and Valentino' is in the lastsemester of her senior year,'' Ball says. ``She has now, to hercredit, two or three Broadway shows on which she has been assistantstage manager and has her Equity card. That's the kind of experienceyou can't buy.''   Ball has even more plans for Duke Drama, including the start-uplate this spring of a professional theater company in Durham. WithKumin and other investors, he has privately funded Duke Street Filmsto make low-budget movies. The profits will be go back to Duke Dramaas well as help finance the new play program with Azenberg.   ``Manny is one of these producers who's really in the businessbecause he loves the theater,'' Ball says. ``So am I, but it'seasier for me. I don't have to worry about selling tickets toooften.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a large, unfinished room on the thirdfloor of a downtown office tower, a stocky, intense man sits on apiano bench and stares at a cardboard stage setting.   Three actors work their way through a scene as the man followstheir movements. He listens to their voices and checks theirreactions to each other.   The scene is repeated, again and again. Between repetitions, theobserver, shadowed by an interpreter, jumps up and walks over to themakeshift scenery to demonstrate what he wants.   Director Yuri Yeremin, who doesn't speak English, is rehearsingan American cast, which doesn't speak Russian, in a hit Soviet playat the Hartford Stage Company. The rehearsal process, which willlast four weeks, is slow but cordial. It's theatrical glasnost inthe making, a unique cultural collaboration made possible by thethaw in Soviet-American relations.   The Hartford Stage experiment occurred after its artisticdirector Mark Lamos traveled to the Soviet Union last year to directa Soviet production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Desire Under the Elms'' atMoscow's Pushkin Drama Theater which Yeremin runs. It was a firstfor an American director. Now Yeremin has returned the favor.   The drama he is directing is Alexander Chervinsky's ``The PaperGramophone.'' It is on view at the Hartford Stage through March 18.Before the recent liberalization of Soviet life under MikhailGorbachev, the play couldn't have been performed in the Soviet Unionin its original version.   ``The Paper Gramophone,'' which is set in the Stalinist era of1948, deals with the awkward romance between a young girl and anaval cadet. Chervinsky's play was written as a film script in 1980but never was produced because of its criticism of Stalin.   With Yeremin's help, Chervinsky adapted ``The Paper Gramophone''for the stage eight years ago. It opened at the Central AcademyTheater of the Soviet Army in Moscow, but was closed quickly bySoviet authorities.   Changes were made in script, and the play was allowed to reopen.   ``The press was so good that it is still running,'' said Yeremin,speaking through an interpreter. ``The Paper Gramophone'' remains inthe repertory of the Central Academy Theater where it is performedseveral times each month.   ``During those years of stagnation, the theater was probably theonly place where you could hear a word of truth,'' Yeremin says.   For the American version, Yeremin has rewritten the play again,going back to the original screenplay. He has also made it clearerfor American audiences who aren't familiar with the details ofSoviet life and politics.   Yeremin found some details of American theater rehearsal andproduction different, to say the least. One he even found``painful.'' In the Soviet Union, the artistic director of a theaterrules. He chooses the actors from his own company for specificroles. There are no auditions.   ``On the one hand, I like auditions a great deal because thedirector has more choice,'' Yeremin says. ``You can look for whatyou really need. On the other hand, I think the theater is a family.So there are other considerations _not just whether the actors fit agiven role, but also that you speak the same language, you have thesame asthetic and the same creative outlook. To me, a production isalways an ensemble. In the Soviet Union, it was easily solvedbecause we have worked together for years.''   That wasn't the case in Hartford, where Yeremin chose twounknowns, Ann Dowd and Ray Virta, for the romantic leads. He waspleased with the quality of the actors who auditioned and wasparticularly taken with Miss Dowd and Virta who, the director says,``looks very Russian.''   During the rehearsal session, the director, the actors, theHartford Stage production team and the theater's dramaturg GregLeaming sit at a long table. Miss Dowd, Virta and a third castmember, Kathleen Chalfant, go over another scene.   Yeremin urges Virta to improvise. The actor complies,embellishing a speech by the young man. The director also tells thedramaturge different dialogue is needed to clarify a situation.   The script, on this third day of rehearsal, remains very fluid.Although he makes the final decision, Yeremin likes to have inputfrom his actors and, with the author's permission, has them createtheir own dialogue.   ``I think it is very unfortunate that in many instances the actoris turned into nothing but a performer,'' the director says. ``It'sas if we are denying the actors the authorship of their creativity.''   Yeremin has even improvised with the work of one of the world'sgreatest authors, Anton Chekhov, adapting his short story, ``WardNumber Six,'' for the stage by allowing actors to improvise for 90minutes based on specific ideas and topics from the story.   Yeremin feels ``The Paper Gramophone'' has universal appeal,transcending its Soviet origins, and that's why he chose it forAmerican audiences.   ``I found that in the fates of the people who inhabit this playthere is much in common with people everywhere,'' he says. ``It is astory of first love, great dreams and the tragic pressure of thetime and the breaking through to other spiritual spaces, shall wesay. The play is full of humor but next to the comedy, there'stragedy.''   The idea of an exchange of Soviet and American directors evolvedin 1986 when Yeremin took over the Puskin Theater. He thought itwould be interesting to have an O'Neill play directed by anAmerican. Through an organization called the Theater InternationalExchange Service and its director Edith Markson, he found Lamos.   ``I never thought that Soviet actors could come up with aproduction in four and a half weeks,'' says Yeremin, referring toLamos' 1988 production of O'Neill at the Pushkin.   In the Soviet Union, directors rehearse a lot longer, Yereminsays. It's an average of six months but sometimes longer, dependingon when the director thinks his production is ready for an audience.   At the Pushkin Theater, where a season of three or four playsusually runs from about the middle of September until the end ofMay, Yeremin has just opened a production of ``Possessed'' by Camus,based on the Dostoyevsky novel. When he returns to Moscow, he willcontinue rehearsals of his next production, ``The Gospel Accordingto Mikhail,'' based on several chapters from the Bulgakov novel,``The Master and Margarita.''   ``I have no hobbies, no other interests,'' the 44-year-oldYeremin says. ``Directing is all that concerns me. Only theater.Everything that doesn't have anything to do with theater bores me totears, except life itself, which is the food of what art is.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Consider the chances of success for a playcalled ``Other People's Money.''

Producing a play off-Broadway also is different from producingon Broadway. Because the theaters are smaller, so are the profitmargins. The line between a profitable and an unprofitable week canbe narrow. Most new off-Broadway shows need time to build audiences.   Ash and Gallin figured they would lose money during the earlyweeks of the run, the time needed for favorable audience reactionto pay off. Their general manager told them to expect 12 weeks oflosses. They budgeted the show at $525,000, including a reservefund of $120,000 raised to pay for a heavy advertising campaign.   ``I had seen too many mornings when the producers have to scurryto try and raise money to run an ad or a television spot,'' Ashsays. ``And then they wind up giving away all their producers'points, selling their soul to get that money.

Now director oftheatrical accounts for Grey Entertainment and Media, Ash was apioneer in developing live-action television ads for Broadway playsand musicals.   Ash worked on the advertising for Sterner's last venture, theshort-lived ``Be Happy for Me.'' Despite its quick departure, theybecame friends. Sterner knew that Ash wanted to produce and broughthim a copy of ``Other People's Money,'' his second play in early1987.   ``I read it and fell quite in love with it,'' Ash recalls.   The story concerns a barracuda-like corporate raider who wantsto take over a family-owned business that is the lifeblood of asmall New England town. The company hires an attractive femaleattorney to battle the takeover artist, and their fights turn fromthe financial to the sexual.   The play had some readings on the West Coast and with actor PaulSorvino, who was interested in playing the lead. He didn't, but theplay was done at his American Stage Company in Teaneck, N.J,. inthe spring of 1987.   Audience reaction was favorable, and Ash had lined up aninvestor to put up half the amount needed to bring the play to NewYork. Then the stock market crashed in October and the moneyevaporated.

She became interested in theplay after a good friend, Davina Belling, went after the movierights.   ``I read a lot of plays, and this one left me with something tothink about,'' Gallin says. ``And it was very entertaining. I evengave it to people who weren't in the theater to read and I got awonderful reaction.''   Ash and Gallin decided to produce the play together off-Broadwayand went looking for a director. The two producers soughtsuggestions from their friends in the theater business. Mark Lamos,artistic director of the Hartford Stage Company, was on the top ofeverybody's list.   Lamos had other commitments, but a play reader at his theaterrecommended it. Lamos finally read ``Other People's Money'' andloved it. The play, directed by Gloria Muzio, was done at theHartford Stage as part of its 1988-89 season.   ``That was a wonderful experience,'' Gallin says. ``It was goodfor the play and for Jerry, who was able to do some rewriting, andfor Gloria, our director, who had time to polish the production.''   It was the Hartford production, with Conway as a last-minutereplacement as the new leading man, that made it to New York.   The show opened with a miniscule advance and a favorable but notoverwhelming review in The New York Times, which didn't deter thetwo producers.   ``We did a radio campaign, sponsoring business reports onall-news radio stations in New York, advertised in the Wall StreetJournal and sent letters to the CEOs of many corporations andinvited them to come,'' Ash says.   Now the stretch limos are regular fixtures in front of theMinetta Lane Theater, as well as more ordinary theatergoers drawnby the favorable word-of-mouth. Ash and Gallin are nowcontemplating a national tour for the play, probably with a star,and also a London production.   ``It's a play that stays with people somehow,'' Ash says. ``Theykeep talking about it for days afterward.

The show opened with a miniscule advance and a favorable but notoverwhelming review in The New York Times, which didn't deter thetwo producers.   ``We did a radio campaign, sponsoring business reports onall-news radio stations in New York, advertised in the Wall StreetJournal and sent letters to the CEOs of many corporations andinvited them to come,'' Ash says.   Now the stretch limos are regular fixtures in front of theMinetta Lane Theater, as well as more ordinary theatergoers drawnby the favorable word-of-mouth. Ash and Gallin are nowcontemplating a national tour for the play, probably with a star,and also a London production.   ``It's a play that stays with people somehow,'' Ash says. ``Theykeep talking about it for days afterward. And even two years afterthe big stock market crash, it's relevant. You pick up thenewspaper and you see this thing about Warner Brothers and Timemagazine and Paramount. The subject is still current.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Each day Willy Russell would drive past theEveryman Theater in Liverpool, England, and see a huge bannerproclaiming, ``March 19, Willy Russell's new play opens.''   Out of such positive statements _ and rapidly approachingdeadlines _ new plays are born.   ``I'd wake up in the middle of the night and think about havingto give back the money to the poor people who already had purchasedtickets,'' the playwright recalls now. ``It was then that thiswoman, Shirley Valentine, sort of came onto the page.''   Since then, she has become something of a cultural phenomenon.The one-woman play was a success more than two years ago inLiverpool, the battered British port city made famous by theBeatles. It was an even bigger hit in London's West End where itwon the prestigious Laurence Olivier Award as best comedy of theyear.   Since then, ``Shirley Valentine'' has played places like WestGermany, Australia, Israel, Scandinavia and now is thriving in NewYork, where it was nominated for a Tony Award as best play ofBroadway's 1988-89 season.   In New York, as in London, the play stars Pauline Collins as abored, lonely, middle-aged English housewife who leaves her husbandand grown children for an amorous adventure in Greece.   At first, Russell was skeptical about writing a monologue.   ``I probably have the same prejudice against the idea ofspending two hours with the same character as anybody else,'' hesays. ``I knew I couldn't write just a one-woman show but rather aplay that happens to have only one character present on stage. Butyou can't convince an audience of that in advance. They'll knowthat when they come out.''   In productions around the world, the audience response hasfollowed the same pattern _ at first, skepticism and no greatadvance sale, then terrific word-of-mouth from audiences andbox-office success.   ``Shirley Valentine'' is the 42-year-old Russell's firstBroadway play. American audiences know an earlier work, ``EducatingRita,'' more from its film version which starred Julie Walters andMichael Caine than from its various regional theater andoff-Broadway productions.   Russell followed a roundabout path to writing plays. Born in asuburb of Liverpool to working-class parents, he dropped out ofschool at 15 and seemed destined for factory work. His fatherwanted him to become a printer, but Russell wanted to write _songs, poetry, even a novel.   ``My family was intensely theatrical, I now realize,'' he says.``They told stories. They sang. They lived their lives through asort of oral theatricality. I think that's why I now write for thestage and not the page.''   His mother suggested he become a ladies' hairdresser, and he did.   For six years, he set hair during the day and at night hungaround beat clubs like the Cavern and played the guitar.   ``I was a terrible hairdresser but I couldn't do anything aboutit,'' he says.   Russell had his music, which by then was folk, and hisperforming.   ``You could write a song and sing it in a club that night,'' hesays. ``You could get a reaction to it. I learned the dynamic ofperformance itself. That's why I have a great deal of sympathy foractors _ because I performed. And because of that experience, Ifinally got out of hairdressing.''   Russell realized that if he became a teacher he could have timeoff in the summer to write. In 1971, he went back to school andwhen a drama department production of ``Peer Gynt'' fell through,he offered to write a play.   ``The second I began writing this play for the stage, I knewthat all the years of trying to write poetry, trying to write thenovel, I was struggling toward this particular moment,'' he says.   Since those days, Russell has made a name for himself, not onlyas the author of ``Educating Rita,'' about a young femalehairdresser who wants more out of life, but as the author of twosuccessful British musicals, ``John, Paul, George, Ringo...andBert'' and ``Blood Brothers.''   ``Shirley Valentine'' originally was called ``Shirley Smith.''   ``Such a poor name,'' muttered Russell's wife. The playwrightfinally settled on ``Shirley Valentine,'' the name of a girl hewent to secondary school with and not anything like Russell's titlecharacter. His character is not modeled on anyone he knows, Russellsays.   Miss Collins, best known in the United States as Sarah, thesaucy maid in ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' wasn't Russell's firstchoice for the role. He always had associated the actress withlight, middle-class parts. It wasn't until he heard her beinginterviewed on the radio that he heard vowel sounds that suggestedthat her origins were not middle class. She was from theMerseyside, the Liverpool area.   ``Shirley Valentine'' transferred triumphantly from England tothe United States with very little changed for American audiences.   ``It's very difficult, especially looking at Broadway from anEnglish point of view, because of the mythology of it; it seemsthat it's the only sort of theatrical area in the world where theaudience is monumentally overprotected,'' Russell says. ``I wantedto get through that without the play being Americanized. If wepresented the inds samples of Vidalia onions andthen conducts chemical tests that may someday enable consumers toidentify the strength of an onion.   The gourmet onions have a reputation of being the sweetest,mildest in the world, but when there are 50 to 60 Vidalias to slicein a day, her lab fills with eye-burning fumes and a pungent odor.   ``I have to wear a mask and goggles,'' Mrs. Hayes said.``Otherwise, my eyes burn and my sinuses throb.''   She and horticulturist Doyle Smittle are collecting informationon sugar and pungency levels in Vidalias.   ``We're trying to develop a rapid, objective method of measuringquality in onions,'' said Smittle. ``We'd like to have a technique... simple enough that a grower or group of growers could measurethe quality in at least every field of onions they have.''   This summer, food scientist Robert Shewfelt will convene a tastepanel at the Experiment Station in Griffin to sample some of thesame onions that have been tested.   Smittle, who has been studying the compounds in onions since themid-1970s, hopes to establish a relationship between the chemicalcomposition of Vidalias and the onions preferred by the taste panel.   Onions have virtually no odor until their tissue is damaged byslicing. At that point, an enzyme triggers a chemical reaction thatproduces ammonia and other substances that cause tears.   Chemical tests give a good indication of an onion's pungency,but they're too complicated and costly for routine use by growers,said Smittle.   Taste buds aren't as reliable as laboratory tests because humanstend to forget how bad or good a sample was, he said. Members ofthe taste panel will sample six onions a day, then they'll comeback a week or two later and evaluate the same onions.   The horticulturist foresees use of an infrared device that wouldscan onions in the packing sheds and determine their mildness.Since sugars absorb infrared light, there may be a correlationbetween taste and the amount of light that passes through onions,he said.   Smittle believes growers eventually will be able to placestickers on each onion, with a picture of a thermometer showing thedegree of mildness. His tests have shown that onion mildness variesfrom field to field and season to season.   With a pungency rating, consumers could use the hotter onions indishes that require more flavor. The rating also would helpconsumers adjust the thickness of slices to specific needs.   Georgia's 260 registered growers and packers have turned theVidalia onion into a $30-million-a-year crop. Protected by statelaw, onions bearing the Vidalia label have to be a yellow Granexhybrid. The growing region encompasses 13 counties in southeasternGeorgia and parts of six other.   Growers claim Vidalias are sweetest because of the variety andthe low-sulfur soil around Vidalia, a town of 10,000 residentsabout 80 miles west of Savannah.	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For Richard Backus, the workweek starts twice _on Tuesday, when he begins the first of eight performances in ``TheCocktail Hour,'' the off-Broadway hit by A.R. Gurney, and onThursday, when he starts writing a new script for ``As the WorldTurns,'' the television soap opera.   ``I've gone from a chaotic actor's life to suddenly becoming avery methodical person,'' Backus was saying the other day in hisUpper West Side apartment, where he does his writing.   Last October, the actor was hired as one of five dialogue writersfor ``As the World Turns,'' the venerable soap opera which has beenrunning five days a week on CBS since 1956. At the same time lastfall, he took a job as standby for Bruce Davison in ``The CocktailHour,'' which concerns a son who has written a play about hisparents and wants their permission to get it produced. Six monthslater, when Davison left the show, Backus took over the role of theson.   ``It means that I literally do nothing else except do the playand then come home to write,'' Backus says.   Soap opera writing is a highly disciplined, tightly structuredcraft. On ``As the World Turns,'' head writer Douglas Marland, arespected veteran of the daytime drama wars, plots the show over thelong term. He is supported by what are called breakdown writers, whodo the plot narratives. They write what will happen on a given day.   These highly detailed scenarios are turned into dialogue by athird group of writers, including Backus. He writes one script, theequivalent of a one-act play, each week.   The writing is regimented in precise segments. According toBackus, each episode of the hour-long ``As the World Turns''contains a prologue and seven acts, made up of from 20 to 25carefully plotted scenes.   ``Each scene ends with a little something to make you go on tothe next scene,'' he says. ``Each act ends with a little somethingto make you sit through the commercials and watch the next act. Thefinal act always has three parts, each one a little cliffhanger. Andthen each Friday show has an especially good cliffhanger to makesure you come back on Monday.''   Backus begins a new script each Thursday after receiving a plotbreakdown. He tries to get most of the show written by Fridayafternoon, but may have to polish up a scene or two over the weekendbetween the three performances of ``The Cocktail Hour'' he gives intwo days.   The finished script is turned in to the producers on Tuesday, aday Backus usually reserves for reading new breakdowns and scriptsby the other dialogue writers, as well as watching taped episodes ofthe show, something he is required to do by contract.   ``In a way, it's a real factory, but it's amazing how creative itis within the format,'' Backus says. ``But what Douglas cares aboutand what drew me to the show initially is that he deals with seriousissues and you get to watch people grapple with real problems. Andhe deals with the problems long term. There are no miracle cures.''   ``As the World Turns,'' set in the mythical Midwestern town ofOakdale, is more of a straightforward domestic drama that doesn'trely on mystery, crime or the bizarre for its plots. It focuses oncharacter and consequently uses a lot of experienced stage actors,such as Kathleen Widdoes, Larry Bryggman, Elizabeth Hubbard andPatrick Tovatt.   Until he started writing for ``As the World Turns,'' the44-year-old Backus had never written professionally. Born inGoffstown, N.H., and educated at Harvard, he made his living as anactor, working in New York theater, an occasional movie, intelevision and on soap operas, including a stint on ``As the WorldTurns'' several years ago.   New York first noticed him in 1972 in the play ``Promenade,All!'', for which he won a Theater World award, and later in acritically praised revival of O'Neill's ``Ah, Wilderness!'' atBroadway's Circle in the Square in which he played the 16-year-oldjuvenile lead at age 30.   Coincidentally, it was a Gurney play, ``Children,'' that firstgot Backus interested in soap operas. In 1976, while waiting tables,he auditioned for the play but didn't take the job because the paywas too low and he had a family to support. Backus told his agent toget him on a soap, so he could afford to do the acting that hewanted to do.   Backus watched ``As the World Turns'' regularly for a year beforehe suggested to its then-producer Robert Calhoun that he wanted towrite for it. He submitted sample scripts and was accepted byCalhoun and Marland. Calhoun, in fact, told him that actors makegood soap opera writers.   ``It's more a process of turning a short novel into workingdialogue,'' Backus says. ``It's very close to what an actor doeswhen he gets a new play and makes it work on stage. So if you have agood background in acting, you have a sense of what works.   ``I now think soap operas combine the best of stage with the bestof film. A stage play like `The Cocktail Hour' is able to focus in ashort time on a very cathartic moment in someone's life. Thewonderful thing about soap operas is that they can deal withcharacters over a long period of time. You get a sense of the realimmediacy and familiarity that you do, to a certain extent, on thestage because it's alive performance.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For much of his career in Broadway musicals,James Brennan has been paid not to perform.   You could find his name in tiny type in the Playbill, usuallybeneath a sentence solemnly proclaiming, ``Understudies neversubstitute for listed players unless a specific announcement is madeat the time of the performance.''   From ``Good News'' to ``So Long, 147th Street'' to ``I Love MyWife'' to ``Little Me'' to ``Singin' in the Rain'' to ``Me and MyGirl,'' Brennan has ``stood by'' or ``covered'' roles, terms used todescribe that unsung hero of live performance _ the understudy.   Now, in a reaffirmation of classic Broadway folklore, theunderstudy has become the star. Brennan has taken over the leadingrole in ``Me and My Girl,'' the long-running British musical about acockney scamp who inherits a title and money but almost loses hisgirlfriend because of his new-found wealth.   ``The day of my first performance here in New York, my wife droveme by the marquee, and I looked at it,'' he says. ``I had a doublefeeling. All at once, I was saying, `I can't believe it.' But I alsothought to myself, `Yeah, it looks just like everybody else's namedid up there.'''   The 38-year-old Brennan has been part of the ``Me and My Girl''company since the show opened in 1986. He was the standby for itsoriginal star, Robert Lindsay, and then for Lindsay's replacement,Jim Dale.   ``It was the best job in New York,'' Brennan says. ``I could comein to work and check in at half hour (before curtain time) and thengo to the theater or go to a restaurant or talk with a friend orread a book or do a crossword puzzle _ and I did all that.''   During Lindsay's nine-month run, Brennan never went on for thestar, but he played the role for about six weeks during Dale's20-month engagement. Replacing a big name can be unnerving for aperformer who must face the wrath of disappointed theatergoersexpecting to see someone else.   ``There is a good understudy mentality and a bad understudymentality,'' Brennan says. ``You have to disregard the groans andthe displeasure that the audience exhibits at the beginning of theevening and hold onto what you know the curtain call will be at theend of the evening.   ``I remember going through a time when I thought `How can I liveup to what the audience expects?''' he adds. ``But you get overthat. It's not your job to worry.''   Brennan originally took the job with ``Me and My Girl'' becausehe had heard the lead role was terrific.   ``I also heard that Bob Lindsay was magic,'' he adds, ``I thoughtI could learn something from him, which, in fact, was the case.''   Last fall, Brennan replaced Tim Curry in the national touringcompany of the show, playing three months around the country beforecoming back to the starring role in New York.   ``Because we have good producers, they tried to find someone witha box-office name,'' he says. ``They didn't find anybody who fit allthe requirements of the role and still had box-office impact.''   So Brennan was chosen for the demanding part. Now he has thrownhimself into a regimen _ a lot of rest and a lot of food so he'llhave enough strength to get through the marathon workout. But it'ssomething he has worked for all his professional career.   Born and raised in Newark, N.J., he remembers discovering theaterprograms an aunt had brought back across the Hudson River fromManhattan. And he recalls lobbying to see either ``The Music Man''or ``Gypsy.'' He didn't get to either one, but the theater bug hadbit.   In high school, Brennan appeared in a musical every year. Thedirector, Robert Hayes, also ran a summer theater in Beach Haven onthe Jersey shore.   ``He asked me if I wanted to be an apprentice there after mysophomore year of high school,'' Brennan recalls. ``In Newark,there's not a lot to do in the summer, so I did. I was there fiveyears, all summer.''   Brennan majored in theater at Rutgers University and aftergraduating went out on the road with a long national tour of ``No,No, Nanette,'' starring June Allyson and later Virginia Mayo.   The director was Donald Saddler who later cast Brennan in thechorus of a revival of the 1927 college musical ``Good News.'' Sincethen, he has never stopped working in the theater. His stints haveincluded roles in a revue ``Rodgers and Hart'' and in ``42ndStreet,'' two shows where he didn't have to understudy anyone.   Brennan also has been back to Beach Haven to direct for Hayes andhas worked for the New Amsterdam Theater Company, directing andchoreographing such old musicals as Cole Porter's ``Jubilee'' andJerome Kern's ``Sally.''   ``I find that everything is sort of a chain in show business,''Brennan says. ``And I've been very lucky.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For much of his career in Broadway musicals,James Brennan has been paid not to perform.

Accompanied by pianist Paul Ford, Patinkin went through aneclectic yet very personal collection of songs, ranging from an AlJolson medley to Stephen Sondheim numbers to a mini-version ofRodgers and Hart's ``Pal Joey,'' a musical he would like to do onBroadway some day.   The sold-out, 90-minute concerts proved to be among the hottesttickets in town. Now he has brought that solo show, called ``MandyPatinkin in Concert: Dress Casual,'' to Broadway for a four-week run(July 25-Aug. 19) at the Helen Hayes Theater.   ``The whole idea was to create something that I love to do sothat I'm not wasting my life just waiting for other projects,''Patinkin was saying the other day. ``I've waited seven months to ayear for something I wanted to do, and I got tired. You spend yourlifetime on the telephone and reading scripts, as opposed tocreating something.''   Patinkin doesn't like to mark time. He's an intense, evendangerous performer, willing to take risks in unusual projects evenif it means falling on his face. And he has _ most notably in ``TheKnife,'' David Hare's critically panned musical about a man whoundergoes a sex-change operation.   But he has gotten back up. Until now, Patinkin has been bestknown for his roles in Broadway musicals like ``Evita'' and ``Sundayin the Park with George,'' or appearances in such movies as``Yentl'' and ``The Princess Bride.''   He also is something of a perfectionist. During his springconcerts, he often stopped a number in mid-song if he felt it wasn'tbeing done correctly or when he bobbled a lyric.   Much of the material in his one-man show comes from an albumreleased earlier this year by CBS Records. The recording was made inconsultation with Ford and Paul Gemignani, a veteran conductor ofBroadway musicals.   Ford and Gemignani fed the singer lists of songs, nearly twodozen of which finally made it to the recording studio. Patinkinspent three or four months walking around the streets of Manhattan,learning songs.   ``I don't read any music,'' says Patinkin, a self-taught singerwho first started singing back in temple on Chicago's South Side atthe age of 8. ``I sit down with Paul Ford and my little cassetterecorder. Paul literally plunks out the notes with one finger in theexact time, and I learn it. Then if I like the song, and it stayswith me, I keep working on it.''   Among the numbers that finally were recorded were standards like``Over the Rainbow'' and ``Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?'' as wellas more obscure material such as ``Coffee in a Cardboard Cup'' fromthe flop Kander and Ebb musical ``70 Girls 70.''   Patinkin found the actual recording of the album cathartic.   ``You're depressed or something, you go into a room and sing acouple of songs and all of a sudden, you feel better,'' he says.``People associate singing with being happy, and I think it's true.When I sing, I feel better.''   Out of the record came the show, born when Joe Papp, head of theShakespeare Festival, offered him the Anspacher. Patinkin wasalready performing there, starring in Shakespeare's ``The Winter'sTale'' six nights a week.   It was on his nights off that Patinkin sang. The money raisedfrom the concerts went to the festival's free Shakespeare in CentralPark and Broadway Cares, an AIDS support group.   ``People had a wonderful time,'' Patinkin says of the soloexperience. ``It was like being at home or in a studio. You canimprovise with just a piano player. You can do things over again andtry new things on the spot.''   The Broadway engagement follows a brief sojourn in Californiawhere Patinkin played a small role in ``Dick Tracy,'' the WarrenBeatty movie about the famous comic strip detective. In the film, heappears as 88 Keys, piano player for Breathless Mahoney, played byrock star Madonna. They get to sing several songs written for themovie by Sondheim. ``Dick Tracy'' is expected to be released nextsummer, and Patinkin has several other movie projects waiting.   But for now he will concentrate on his Broadway show and possiblymore concerts with orchestras around the country after that.   ``When I look back on those songs on the album and in the show,they are all tales, either about the past, the present or the futureand concern things I like or have worked on,'' Patinkin says.   ``In the case of Sondheim, many of them are reflections orlessons on how we should live our lives. In the case of `Over theRainbow' and other songs, they are like dreams, what we hope for.They all spoke to me in a way. They have to do with how I feel.Maybe that's why I like them.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In one 12-month period, Christine Baranski gotmarried, appeared in her first Broadway hit, won a Tony and had ababy.   What to do for an encore?   Have another baby, take a sabbatical from the theater, come backto do a challenging play like ``Hedda Gabler'' in regional theaterand then star on Broadway in ``Rumors,'' the latest Neil Simonsuccess.   All that took more than a year, Miss Baranski admits, but thenit's not easy to juggle a marriage, a family and the theater.   At one time, a big-time theater career seemed almost out ofreach. Seven years ago, the actress was preparing to go on stage ata tiny off-off-Broadway theater, the kind of dismal, out-of-the-wayplace with a well-worn ambiance, miniscule salaries and one dressingroom for a dozen actors.   ``I was thinking to myself, `I can't believe I spent all thoseyears studying at Juilliard and now I'm sitting on a toilet in awarehouse, waiting to make my entrance,''' she recalls. ``Theexperience was difficult.''   Difficult until she saw a New York Times review the next day,praising her performance in the play, a one-act, two-charactercomedy called ``The Undefeated Rumba Champ.''   From then on, she knew she would make it in the theater. Criticsand audiences reinforced her opinion, later applauding herperformances in plays by William Shakespeare and Tom Stoppard. Herhonors include an Obie for ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''off-Broadway and a Tony for Stoppard's ``The Real Thing'' onBroadway.   For the moment, Miss Baranski is holding forth in much morecomfortable surroundings, a dressing room just inside the stage doorof Broadway's Broadhurst Theater where ``Rumors'' has settled in fora run. But the acting hasn't gotten any easier.   Consider the plot of ``Rumors,'' which has been described by theplaywright as a farce. To make the play work, Miss Baranski has toimagine: one, a good friend has shot himself; two, he's bleeding todeath, and three, news of the shooting must be hushed up at allcosts, even from the victim's good friends who begin arriving withastonishing frequency.   ``You have to make all of that real to yourself,'' she saysmatter of factly. ``That's the essence of working in a comedy. Youbelieve it, and the audience laughs.''   They laugh at her slow disintegration from stylish suburbanmatron, done up in designer duds, to hysterical housewife, breakingout in hives, swigging vodka and ready to kill for a cigarette.   ``This is not a difficult role in that the intentions are verystraightforward,'' Miss Baranski says. ``What's happening to thecharacter is very clear. Other roles can be difficult because youhave trouble figuring out why the character is doing what she'sdoing.''   When the show started its pre-Broadway trek last September at SanDiego's Old Globe Theater, some of the cast members, Miss Baranskiincluded, couldn't get to sleep until 2 a.m. because of the play'shigh energy.   ``Ultimately with farce, what you are playing is events, andyou're playing the situation,'' she says. ``It's really not aboutcharacters, and it's not about relationships. Most of the linescommunicate information about what's going on. They're funny becauseSimon writes funny.''   But it's not easy to act.   ``With farce you really have to maintain the same performanceevery night,'' the actress says. ``You can't change, because it willaffect what other people do on stage. You almost have to say thesame line readings and the same rhythms. When I rehearsed this role,I didn't realize I'd have to do it every night.''   Miss Baranski is one of those actresses who rarely was unemployedin the theater after she graduated from drama school in 1974,although she often had to leave New York to get a job.   The show business bug bit early, back in Cheektowaga, N.Y, aBuffalo suburb. Although her parents were not actors, hergrandparents had been performers in Buffalo's Polish theater.   ``I think what did it for me was that my father once took me tothe ballet,'' she says. ``I got that feeling about performing veryyoung.''   At 16, she was a member of the Buffalo Theater Workshop which, inthe heady revolutionary days of the late 1960s, joined forces withthe New York Theater Workshop to do street theater in places likeBedford-Stuyvesant.   Miss Baranski studied at the Juilliard School in New York forfour years. One of her instructors, Michael Kahn, got her a smalljob at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Connecticut. ``It was alady in waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting,'' she laughs.   Regional theater beckoned, and Miss Baranski went out to thehinterlands.   ``I think you learn by doing really great plays,'' she says. At apoint in her late 20s, she decided to stay in New York.``Eventually, you have to let people know who you are.''   Director Mike Nichols saw her in ``Crackers,'' a little-knownfilm by Louis Malle, and in the workshop production of ``Sunday inthe Park with George.'' He cast her as Jeremy Irons' wife in ``TheReal Thing'' which arrived on Broadway in early 1984.   ``That put me on the map,'' she says. ``I think the only thingthat really gets you there is if you're in a hit.''   She married actor Matthew Cowles right before going into ``TheReal Thing.'' Their first daughter, Isabel, was born in September1984.   The actress went into such long-running shows as ``Hurly Burly''and ``The House of Blue Leaves.'' When she got pregnant again, MissBaranski took a year off to have her second daughter, Lily.   Studio Arena, a regional theater in Buffalo, enticed her back tothe stage last spring in ``Hedda Gabler'' and from there she wentinto ``Rumors.''   ``All this would have been harder if I hadn't established mycareer,'' Miss Baranski says. ``But I felt with `The Real Thing'something was really satisfied, and I don't feel as compelled toprove myself. I can take time off and feel OK about it. And now I'mdoing `Rumors.' I said to myself, `See, you can disappear for a yearand you can come back. You'll get work.'''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than four months after taking a detour fromdance to star on Broadway in a stage version of Kafka's``Metamorphosis,'' Mikhail Baryshnikov still calls his first theaterexperience ``scary.''   ``It means going out there every night and speaking those firstfew words of dialogue,'' says the man who has thrilled the world ofWestern ballet ever since he defected from the Soviet Union in1974.``Sometimes you have to push the sounds out of your throat.''   Baryshnikov has been fighting that fear eight times a week in``Metamorphosis,'' Steven Berkoff's adaptation of Franz Kafka'sshort novel about a young man named Gregor Samsa who awakens onemorning to find he has turned into an insect.   ``There is something about theater in general,'' he says quietly.``You have to go out there and tell a story with words. When peoplecome to the ballet, they expect you will dance.''   Baryshnikov sat in his dressing room in the Metropolitan OperaHouse where American Ballet Theater, which he runs, is rehearsingits summer season. He was in the middle of a five-week break from``Metamorphosis'' to keep the ballet company up to performance leveland star for one benefit performance in Martha Graham's ballet``Night Journey.''   Now he has returned to the play which has reopened at the EthelBarrymore Theater for a limited run through July 15.   ``I didn't know what to expect because it was my first theaterexperience,'' says Baryshnikov, who has already tried the movieswith such films as ``The Turning Point'' and ``White Nights.'' ``Ijust pretty much went with Steven's directions. In a certain sense,I tried to imitate him because he is a great mime. When herehearses, he does all the parts, not only Gregor. During therehearsal, I was pretty much amazed by his metamorphosis.''   Baryshnikov first saw the play last year in Paris when RomanPolanski played the bug in a production also directed by Berkoff.The dancer calls Polanski ``the godfather'' of ``Metamorphosis'' onBroadway.   ``I was very moved by his performance,'' Baryshnikov recalls.``He was quite wonderful. We ended up just talking about theater ingeneral. He said, `If you are that interested in theater, why don'tyou try it? I think you will have a lot of fun with this role as Ido.'''   Several weeks later, producer Lars Schmidt, who bankrolled theParis production, called Baryshnikov and suggested he considerappearing in the show on Broadway.   The play was first done at Duke University in North Carolina inFebruary, to give the dancer a chance to get used to his new role asactor not dancer, and moved to New York the following month.   His portrait of Gregor came from many sources, he says.   ``I remembered certain things about Polanski's performance,''Baryshnikov says. ``And there was also my humble ideas about this,too. Those combinations worked together.''   The dance superstar also learned a great deal by watching otheractors _ particularly Rene Auberjonois, Laura Esterman and MadeleinePotter who play his father, mother and sister in the show.   ``I saw what kind of choices they made in the day-to-dayrehearsals and from performance to performance,'' Baryshnikov says.``There are endless possibilities of interpretation, but I wasn'tsure how free I could be in this material.''   Berkoff, an English playwright and actor, wrote ``Metamorphosis''in the late 1960s and since then has directed nearly a dozenproductions of it around the world. The Broadway set resembles agiant spider, an iron jungle gym from which Baryshnikov hangs orscurries about on all fours.   ``The movement was a collaboration between myself and Steven, buta lot of it was pretty much set, particularly the main positions andwhat to do with my arms,'' Baryshnikov says. ``But Steven said thateveryone adds a slightly different quality to the choreography ofit.''   The performer knew a lot of Kafka's works, particularly ``TheTrial'' and his diaries.   ``A lot of Gregor is in Kafka's life,'' he says. ``The role isvery much Kafka's thoughts about his relationship with his familyand the way he felt about them.''   The vocal aspect of the role was the most difficult for him. Toprepare, Baryshnikov began taking voice lessons last fall with avoice teacher at the Juilliard School.   ``I first learned English from the streets and from television,''he says. ``I imitated it phonetically. When I speak Russian I speakwith a much deeper voice because it is more natural for me. Theteacher from Juilliard taught me how to breathe on stage and notchoke myself.''   But is there a bit of Baryshnikov in Gregor, too?   ``In any role, whether you are a dancer or a singer or an actor,there is a part of you, a part of your experience as a human being,a part of your past, the way you have been brought up,'' he says.``Your life experience reflects through any role.''   ``Metamorphosis'' has opened the door to new stage and filmoffers, but he hasn't committed himself to any just yet.   ``I might try to wear too many hats,'' he says. ``There are a fewroads I can take.   ``I would like to rest, think, read, travel and spend more timewith my daughter,'' says Baryshnikov referring to his 8-year-olddaughter, Shura, who lives with her mother, actress Jessica Lange.``In the last few years, I've had to make a lot of decisions withoutthe full understanding of what I'm getting into. There was no timefor thinking.''   His days still begin with early morning dance classes, whether heis appearing in ``Metamorphosis'' or not.   How will he know when to stop dancing?   ``I will know pretty much and it will be my decision, but I havesome good friends who will say to me, `Get off the stage.'''   ``I am slowing down,'' adds the 41-year-old star. ``If I'mdancing, I want to learn something new like Martha Graham's ``NightJourney.'' I am not interested anymore just to dance for dance'ssake, particularly roles which I have been doing for many years.When life is passing by, you really have to do something new all thetime.''   End Adv for Sunday, June 25	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Musicals that flop out of town rarely areresurrected on Broadway. One exception is ``Chu Chem,'' whichfolded in Philadelphia in 1966 and now has found a new life nearly23 years later at New York's Ritz Theater.   ``It's the longest work-in-progress in the history ofBroadway,'' jokes Mitch Leigh, the man who wrote the music for thisshow about a Jewish community in 16th-century China. Leigh also isco-producer of the latest and, he hopes, final version.   ```Chu Chem' was never finished in Philadelphia,'' Leigh says.``We knew what was wrong. We just never rewrote it.''   For its four creators and especially Leigh, the new ``Chu Chem''is more than a revival. It is a tying up of loose ends, acompletion of tasks left undone.   ``It all started when I was approaching my 60th birthday,'' the61-year-old Leigh says. ``I was thinking about what I hadn't donein my life that I wanted to do. One thing was to play my music in ajazz band, which I eventually did at the Metropolitan Museum of Artlast year. The other was `Chu Chem.'''   The idea for the show originated with Ted Allan, a Canadianactor and writer, who first thought about ``Chu Chem'' more than 30years ago during a visit to China.   ``I discovered that there were still people in a town calledKaifeng who called themselves Hebrews,'' he recalls. ``Then I beganto match my knowledge of Talmudic folk tales with what I wasdiscovering about Chinese folk tales. They were similar.''   What Allan learned eventually evolved into the book of ``ChuChem,'' the story of the search by an old man and his family for alost tribe of Jews in China.   ``I wrote it for Zero Mostel,'' the author says. ``But Zeroturned it down and went into something called `Fiddler on theRoof.'''   But Mostel showed the script to director Albert Marre whobrought in Leigh. ``Chu Chem'' was on its way _ at least as far asPhiladelphia. The show, which starred Menasha Skulnik as the agingpatriarch and Molly Picon as his wife, died there, the victim ofpoor reviews and the departure of Miss Picon who left the cast evenbefore opening night.   ``In Philadelphia we were guilty of overkill,'' says co-lyricistJim Haines. ``The story got subverted. Its poignancy, its humor,its simple beauty and what it was trying to say were lost.''   Leigh agrees. He and Marre felt that lurking in the flop showwas a marvelous musical. But work on it didn't resume until themiddle of 1986 when the director and composer got together withAllan. Soon Haines and co-lyricist Jack Wohl got involved again.   Getting the collaborators together wasn't easy. Leigh, thecomposer of ``Man of La Mancha'' and producer of Yul Brynner's lastmarathon tour of ``The King and I,'' lives in New York. Allanresides in Toronto. Wohl lives in Los Angeles, while Haines makeshis home in South Africa.   ``I stopped getting bills from the telephone company. I gotthank-you notes,'' Wohl says. ``It was difficult for us to gettogether, but when we did, it was very rewarding.''   ``Let me put it another way,'' says Leigh. ``It's very difficultto argue under those circumstances.''   Allan eliminated the mother from the tale, so the plot couldfocus on the relationship between the father and his outspokendaughter as well as a love story between the daughter and a Chineseprince. Leigh added four new melodies, while Wohl and Hainesrewrote 80 percent of the lyrics.   ``Once we had agreed to do this rewrite, we all felt very securehaving Mitch around,'' Allan says. ``We felt secure because he notonly wrote good music, but we knew he had a lot of experienceproducing shows. I sensed that if we came up with something good,Mitch would get it on.   ``Basically, it's a new play but we held onto the old titlebecause we were all in love with it,'' Allan says. ``I saw italways for what it was. Meaning, that if it were done, it's afable. It's a fairy tale.''   The new incarnation of ``Chu Chem'' was first done last Decemberat the Jewish Repertory Theater, a tiny playhouse on 14th Street.   ``The purpose of the production downtown was to get `Chu Chem'on its feet so people could hear it,'' Wohl says. And they likedwhat they heard. The show created enough box-office interest thatit could have run for two years at the 99-seat theater.   ``The discipline imposed on the collaborators at JRT forced usto keep the show's simplicity intact,'' Haines says. ``What emergedwas a simple, beautiful, poignant piece of work.''   The reviews also were positive, encouraging Leigh andco-producer William Rollnick to move the musical to Broadway andthe Ritz. Leigh knows he is taking a chance with a modest musicalwith a cast of unknown performers, headed by Mark Zeller and EmilyZacharias, by subjecting it to the harsh light and economics ofBroadway.   But he believes good word-of-mouth and cheaper-than-usualtickets, priced under $40, will bring in theatergoers. Even if itdoesn't, Leigh believes he has been paid back.   ``The resurrection of `Chu Chem' was my interest,'' he says.``The fact that it occurred means I already have been paid off. Itwill now exist for all time as a musical, and that's enough forme.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On one side of the stage stand the Jets, on theother side the Sharks. The rival gangs from ``West Side Story''huddle around microphones and watch conductor Paul Gemignani on asmall podium in the middle of a vast wood-paneled room filled withmusicians.   It's a Sunday morning and the cast and orchestra of ``JeromeRobbins' Broadway'' are in RCA Records' Studio A on West 44thStreet.   The singers look at Gemignani. The conducter, wearingheadphones, glances at a man standing over a control panel in asoundproof booth near the stage. Take after take is recorded untilJay David Saks is satisfied.   Saks, an RCA Records producer, is the man who must capture thesound of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' a celebration of some of thebiggest musical hits by the famous director and choreographer.Besides a suite of dances from ``West Side Story,'' the showincludes numbers from ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``The King and I,''``Gypsy,'' ``Peter Pan'' and others.   The final result, released in May on two records or twocassettes or two compact discs, is one of the most lavish originalcast recordings ever made. It includes more than 120 minutes ofmusic and a 62-page booklet with extensive notes on each of themusicals included in the show.   ``Cast albums are very demanding,'' says Saks, who has been inthe recording business since 1972 when he was hired by cast albumguru Thomas Z. Shepard at Columbia Records. ``They require a greatdeal of advance preparation and a lot of study. If you're going torecord the Beethoven `Seventh Symphony,' you don't have to sitthere in advance and decide whether you're going to take it up akey or whether you're going to leave out the third movement.   ``But in the case of a Broadway show, you have a theatrical workthat's designed for the stage, and how does it translate to arecord when you have nothing to go by except what you're hearing,''he says. ``Frequently you have to change the reality of what ishappening musically to re-create more accurately the memory in thelistener.''   Before the taping sessions, Saks wasn't sure how ``JeromeRobbins' Broadway'' would work on record. It presented specialproblems.   ``Most of this music is familiar, and most of it has beenrecorded before,'' he recalls. ``For example, you don't want tohave just another recording of `West Side Story.' Plus there's alot of dance music and music with no vocals in the show. So what doyou do with it?''   Saks decided to record not just the music, but the feel of thestage production. He brought in the cast to tape a lot of what hecalls ``crowd material,'' not just the singing. In the case of the``West Side Story'' segment, that meant having 30 or 40 or 50people up on stage making fight or dance hall sounds for the``Mambo'' number or the fight sequence.   ``I think without that, we would have ended up with anothersmall orchestra recording of music from `West Side Story,''' hesays. ``We wanted to make it feel like you were in the theater.''   Many of the composers and lyricists represented in ``JeromeRobbins' Broadway,'' including Stephen Sondheim, Morton Gould, JuleStyne, Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, came to the Februaryrecording sessions after having pre-production conferences withSaks.   In the past, most Broadway musicals were recorded in one day,usually the company's day off. Some still are, but ``JeromeRobbins' Broadway'' took three days, spread over two weeks, tocomplete.   For one reason, it was twice as long as a regular castrecording. It has a large cast _ 62 performers _ and a largeorchestra _ 42 musicians plus two players added for the ``Fiddleron the Roof'' segment.   For another, technical advances have allowed for more materialto be placed on a record, tape or compact disc.   ``In the old days, there was a limitation as to how much musicyou could put on a record without having the recording suffertechnically,'' Saks says. ``If there were 60 minutes worth ofrecordable music in a show, producers had to make some harddecisions as what to keep and what not to keep because theycouldn't get more than 22 or 24 minutes on a side.''   Today, compact discs can handle up to 74 or 75 minutes ofmaterial without much difficulty. More of a show can be put on asingle CD than could ever fit on a record.   ``Now, we say that anything worth recording, we do record,''Saks says.   Saks jumped to RCA in 1974 when Shepard did. He also became aproducer of classical recordings, supervising albums by suchorchestras as the Chicago Symphony conducted by James Levine andthe Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. But he alsoassisted Shepard on some of the best cast recordings ever made,including ``Sunday in the Park with George'' and ``Sweeney Todd.''   His first solo cast recording as a producer was ``Starting Here,Starting Now,'' a tiny off-Broadway musical revue by David Shireand Richard Maltby Jr. When Shepard left RCA in 1986, Saks tookover its Broadway cast album production. In the last two years, hehas done ``Anything Goes,'' ``Legs Diamond'' and ``Into theWoods,'' for which he won a Grammy.   And RCA has dominated the cast album market since, alsorecording such Broadway shows as ``Chess'' and ``Sarafina!'' duringthe same time period. Saks didn't do those recordings. They wereproduced by their own composers.   ``I'm a strong believer in not doing what you don't think youcan do well,'' he says.	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On one side of the stage stand the Jets, on theother side the Sharks.

It just seems that way.   In nearly 35 years as a performer, Bosco has appeared in 99plays, 61 of them in New York, according to his extensive Playbillbiography. He usually shuttles between Broadway's Circle in theSquare and off-Broadway's Roundabout Theater Company, sometimesplaying both in one season.   But his broad, beefy, Irish face is not well-known beyond theHudson River. That may change with Bosco's critically praisedperformance in Ken Ludwig's farce, ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' and hisgrowing movie career in such films as ``Children of a Lesser God,''``Three Men and a Baby'' and ``Working Girl.''   In ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' now on view at Broadway's RoyaleTheater, Bosco plays an apoplectic opera company manager. In it, hemanages to turn frenzy into high, hilarious art.   Theater has always been Bosco's major focus, and he has hadseven good reasons to keep working steadily in it. His children:Diane, Philip, Chris, Jenny, Lisa, Celia and John.   ``My wife, Nancy, has been a wonderful manager,'' the58-year-old Bosco says. ``I've never been interested in money. Ithas never mattered to me. Money was the cause of a great deal ofdifficulty in my family when I was a kid.''   Bosco's father was in the small carnival business in JerseyCity, N.J. His family would travel, mostly during the summers,throughout the Northeast.   ``As a kid, I used to work mostly in penny pitch,'' Boscorecalls. ``Then I began to work ball games where you'd knock thebottles down, then wheel games and when I got older, even gamblingjoints. It was not your average, run-of-the-mill childhood.''   In Catholic grammar school, the nuns thought Bosco was a prettygood reader. It's there he made his stage debut at the age of 12,playing Machevilli the cat in a little something called ``The FairyCobbler.''   ``I was a big success because I played with my tail all throughthe show,'' he says.   Acting had made an impression on Bosco. In high school, heappeared in the winter and spring plays, entered elocutionarycontests and was on the debating team. He ended up at CatholicUniversity in Washington and was a regular on the local Washingtontheater circuit, including stints at a summer theater in Olney,Md., and at fledgling Arena Stage.   In 1960, Bosco and his wife moved to the New York area for good,settling in Teaneck, N.J., where they still live.   His New York career did not have an auspicious beginning. Whilerehearsing his first show _ ``Measure for Measure'' in Central Park_ his car was broken into and the belongings he was moving fromWashington were stolen.   But the play and Bosco got good notices. The actor landed anagent and his New York career was launched. Much of his early dayswere spent at Lincoln Center in its repertory company run by JulesIrving and Herbert Blau.   ``But when Irving left Lincoln Center in 1973, I was out of workfor about 18 months,'' he recalls. ``That's the longest I've everbeen out of a job. My wife went to work, and I took part-time jobsoutside the theater.   ``When you are in a reof getinsulated and you get removed from the Broadway scene,'' he says.``You're not thought of for shows. After a while, people stopcalling.''   Eventually, people, Joseph Papp in particular, did. Bosco wentback to Lincoln Center, when Papp took over there, to appear withRuth Gordon in George Bernard Shaw's ``Mrs. Warren's Profession''and then replaced Raul Julia in ``The Threepenny Opera.'' Sincethen, Bosco hasn't stopped working.   In ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' Bosco co-stars with Victor Garber, anactor he has worked with before in ``You Never Can Tell'' and ``TheDevil's Disciple'' at Circle in the Square.   It was Garber who suggested Bosco for the role of the operacompany manager to the show's producers and to director Jerry Zaks.   ``Jerry's attention to detail is all-encompassing,'' Bosco says.``Nothing escapes him. He will work on a thing until he issatisfied with it. You work very hard. Pace is the critical thing.You have to keep ahead of the audience all the time.''   With farce, Bosco says, you sometimes can go too fast.   ``I remember coming off and being annoyed with myself because Istumbled over three or four words in a scene,'' he says. ``Usuallyit's for lack of concentration but in this case it was because Iwas talking faster than I was thinking.   ``That's why comedy is so difficult to play. When you make amistake, it's so obvious. You can really screw up in a drama, wherethere are pauses and stops, and no one would know that you've doneit.''   At the urging of his family and his agent, Bosco has made some15 to 20 films in the last five years. The roles have been small,but the salaries were enormous.   ``You can't make any money in the theater,'' he says. ``If youare lucky enough to get in a Broadway show, who knows how long it'sgoing to run.''   Was it hard to break into movies?   ``When you work in the theater, they tend not to think of youfor movies,'' Bosco says. ``They're just different communities.

Supporting this dream is why LuPone returns periodically to ``AChorus Line,'' Broadway's longest running musical. He was theoriginal Zach, the enigmatic director in the show when it opened onBroadway 14 years ago.   ``I don't even play a full week in `A Chorus Line' because halfthe time I'm doing something here,'' he says, referring to theManhattan Class Company. ``But I evidently bring something of valueto the show because they accept me on those terms.''   LuPone started Manhattan Class in 1983 with Bernard Telsey, aone-time actor. The company grew out of an acting class thatLuPone, a veteran member of such groups as Actors Studio and CircleRepertory, was teaching. Telsey, who had been been a theateradministration major, was one of his students at New YorkUniversity.   ``I never found the ensemble that I was looking for, so I formedmy own,'' says the 42-year-old LuPone.   ``But I didn't want to form another acting company,'' herecalls. ``So Bernie and I decided to develop new plays to sell toproducers. It would be a for-profit company and we would presentstaged readings of new American plays.''   Its guiding principle would be that playwrights would have thetime here to develop an idea in workshop using professional actorsand directors. Their first reading six years ago was optioned forBroadway the next day.   ``We thought we were really hot stuff,'' LuPone recalls. ``Butwe learned. Two and a half years later, the play still wasn'tproduced.''   That first season, Manhattan Class did four readings each ofthree plays-in-progress for would-be producers, a process thatcontinued until 1986.   ``The adventure of collaboration turns me on _ the director, theactor and the playwright working together,'' LuPone says. ``Whenyou have a play that's already written, half of the challenge isgone.''   To survive, Manhattan Class switched in 1986 to non-profitstatus and became more of a mainstream theater when it began togive seasonal one-act productions at its tiny space on Theater Row.The following year, one of their one-act efforts, ``Beirut,'' afuturistic AIDS play by Alan Bowne, was done commerciallyoff-Broadway.   ``The reason that a year could pass between festivals is that wedon't have the money or we are out working,'' the actor says.``This is everybody's second job.''   LuPone, big brother to Broadway actress Patti LuPone, has beenin show business for nearly 30 years. The Long Island nativestarted as a dancer at 15. After graduating from Juilliard, hemoved on to theater roles, working in some Broadway shows that werehits like ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``The Magic Show'' andothers that never made it to New York like ``Nefertiti.''   But it's ``A Chorus Line'' that has been LuPone's annuity overthe years.   He was a dancer in director Michael Bennett's original workshopproductions in 1975 and when the role of the director, modeledafter Bennett himself, was created, LuPone knew he could do it.   Since then, he has had almost a love-hate relationship with thepart of Zach.   ``It's just a facility for the dancers to talk to,'' saysLuPone, explaining that the show is built around a series ofauditions by dancers for a director who almost never is seen onstage.   ``Plus I have diametrically opposed experiences in `A ChorusLine,''' he recalls. ``I did it 14 years ago when there were yellsand screams and standing ovations. We were the darling of the town.Now you get Japanese tourists who don't understand what's going on;it's not a full house, and there are no yells.''   If a job interests him or the money is good, LuPone will tearhimself away from the Manhattan Class Company. In 1987, he starredon Broadway in the infamous ``Late Nite Comic,'' a four-performancemusical flop. Last fall, he traveled to the Cleveland Play Housefor a chance to appear in Budd Schulberg's stage adaptation of ``Onthe Waterfront.''   Running a company has mellowed LuPone's own intense careerdesires that dominated his early acting days.   ``I was intense because I was so hungry,'' he says. ``When youhave your own theater company, my approval and acceptance doesn'tcome from acting anymore or whether people like me. It comes fromsomething of content, hopefully. That's the difference in me nowvs. me 10 years ago.''   LuPone and Telsey are now planning the company's 1989-90 season.If things go according to schedule and the duo can raise the funds,they will do full-length new American plays in the fall and springwith a one-act festival held in the winter. Their budget is anestimated $250,000, most raised from corporate and foundationgrants.   ``You start with the hope of what the theater can and shouldbe,'' LuPone says. ``That's why I get people to work here forlittle or no money. That's what we sell, not necessarily a superiorproduct. What we do sell is a community of committed artists.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Steve Ross performs the music of Cole Porter andNoel Coward with a wit, style and sophistication that those twomasters of song would appreciate.   Most nights you'll find him behind the piano at L'Omnibus deMaxim's, the Madison Avenue watering hole modeled after its famousParis namesake.   Maxim's, with its elegant charm, is the perfect setting forsomeone who plays and sings the songs of not only Porter and Cowardbut other musical geniuses such as Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart,Arlen, Kern and Sondheim, too.   With his slick-backed hair and impeccable tailoring, Ross evokesanother era, a time when men dressed for dinner, wore tuxedos toopening night at the opera, drank martinis instead of mineral waterand had seen every hit Broadway musical at least twice.   Ross has been a part of the New York cabaret scene since thelate '60s when he arrived from Washington, D.C. But his love ofmusic, particularly popular music, started much earlier. As achild, Ross remembers listening to Beatrice Kay who sang songs ofthe Gay '90s, old-fashioned ditties like ``Heaven Will Protect theWorking Girl'' and ``She's Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage.''   ``They were real numbers,'' Ross recalls. ``The seeds were beingplanted even back then for that kind of vaudeville performing. Thecabaret stuff that performers do now is really an outgrowth of whatvaudeville was. There's the idea of building a number or getting toan ending.''   It was one of those types of numbers _ ``Don't Go in the Lion'sCage Tonight'' _ which became the first song Ross sang in public,warbling in what he calls his ``cracked baritone voice.''   ``Roberta Flack was a big influence,'' he recalls. ``At thetime, she was a piano and singing teacher and worked a little clubon Capitol Hill.   ``I would go there for brunch, get mildly high on Bloody Marysand she would come on and break our hearts,'' he recalls. ``Everyonce in a while, she would invite me up to sing and I would do`Don't Go in the Lion's Cage Tonight.'''   Before the rock era took over, Ross dabbled in classical musicand played in little dance bands in the Washington area. But thenManhattan beckoned, and Ross didn't say no to jobs in small clubsin New York and teaching voice to students. It wasn't easy.   ``I didn't start out at the Ritz,'' he says. ``I've worked insome places that are now video stores.''   At first, he didn't sing. But when he discovered nightspots weremore eager to hire a singer than just a piano player, he would.   ``I started singing funny little songs, patter songs,'' he says.``So I started taking lessons and still do, to keep me on thestraight and narrow.''   Even then, he was carefully cultivating his image as urbansophisticate.   ``I always wore my little tie and I always sang Cole Portersongs,'' Ross says. ``People said, `Keep doing that.' Andfortunately that kind of music came around again. I didn't knowanything else. I kept doing the songs that I liked to do.''   Audiences really began discovering Ross in the late 1970s whenhe played a now-disappeared club and restaurant called Ted Hook'sBackstage, located just west of Eighth Avenue in the theaterdistrict.   Over his piano there was built a big false piano around whichcustomers could sit. Diners in the large restaurant could also hearhim.   ``While the club was there, it was really a wonderful amalgam,''Ross says. ``People came to look, people came to be looked at.Stagehands and stars.''   Alice Faye would get up and sing or Liza Minnelli would joinRoss in a duet.   Audiences also discovered Ross' passion for obscure good songs.An enthusiastic sheet music collector, he searches everywhere fornew old material and has resurrected many an unknown Porter orCoward rarity. The title of his new album, ``Most of Every Day,''is a rare Coward song. Now people bring him songs, new and old.   How does Ross pick the songs he sings?   ``The words have to work first,'' he says. ``When it's just meand the piano, I want to have good words. I can't make it on a highnote. I'm not Pavarotti. So the words have to be important.''   In 1981, Ross became the first performer in 40 years to play theAlgonquin Hotel's famed Oak Room. He stayed for four years. Sincethen, he hasn't given his passport a rest. London. Venice. HongKong. Australia. Even Kenya, where he wowed them in Nairobi. Nowhe's ready to hang his hat in New York for a while. It's the citythat suits him best. Its possibilities are endless.   ``The essence of romance is possibility,'' Ross says. ``That'swhy New York is such a romantic place. Anything can happen: youcross the street, something comes to town, you go into a place.That's why I can't leave this city. Anything can happen here.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tony Lo Bianco gives casting directors, not tomention audiences, fits.   Most can't quite remember what he looks like or where they sawhim before. They have seen him as young and old, short and tall,skinny and fat.   He has played gangsters, prizefighters, communists, cowboys,policemen, soldiers in ancient Rome, longshoremen, psychopaths,baseball players and scores of others in productions by everybodyfrom Eugene O'Neill to Sylvester Stallone.   After critics raved about his performance as the hot-headed EddieCarbone in the 1983 Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's ``A Viewfrom the Bridge,'' he was offered a lot roles as tough Italianfathers. Now he's bracing for a different kind of part.   ``I'll probably get a slew of short, fat roles,'' Lo Bianco says.   The reason?   The actor is starring in ``Hizzoner!,'' a one-man show based onthe life of New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and currently on viewat Broadway's Longacre Theater.   ``Now they'll say, `Tony has gone to pot,''' the 52-year-old LoBianco says. ```He's gotten fat.'''   And shorter, too.   The 5-foot-9 Lo Bianco, a one-time Golden Glover, plays the5-foot-3 LaGuardia without losing an inch.   ``I do it smaller on stage,'' the actor laughs. ``That's the funof it. You can appear to shrink.''   The actor did gain a little weight for the show. But then, he hasalso taken off pounds if the role demanded it.   ``You have to move your body around to conform to what you'regoing to play,'' Lo Bianco says. ``As an actor, you should be amarshmallow or a piece of sponge. You've got to push your face andbody around to pay tribute to the script and the character someonewrote.''   LaGuardia, a non-stop worker, was one of New York's best-knownand most colorful mayors. During his three terms in office, from1934 through 1945, he followed fire trucks to fires, read thefunnies over the radio when there was a newspaper strike, supervisedmany large building projects, including what came to be known asLaGuardia Airport, and even balanced the city's budget.   The difficulty with playing LaGuardia, who died in 1947, is thatmany people still remember the way he looked and the way he talked.Not only from their own memories, but from newsreels, old radioprograms and even Tom Bosley's Tony award-winning portrayal of himin the 1959 musical ``Fiorello.''   ``Hizzoner!,'' which was written by Paul Shyre, has been in theworks since 1983 when it was commissioned by a New York publictelevision station. Shyre thought of Lo Bianco for the role. The twomen had known each other since they worked together in HaroldClurman's acting classes.   It was decided to do ``Hizzoner!'' on stage first, so the playhad several incarnations over the years at regional theaters inAlbany and Syracuse before making the trip to New York.   The refinement of the play became a selection process.   ``You're dealing with a man who was mayor for 12 years and acongressman for seven terms, so there's a lot to talk about,'' LoBianco says.   ``We wanted to give an understanding of why this man accomplishedwhat he accomplished and what in his background made him think theway he did. What triggered things that made him be the kind of humanbeing he was _ a tremendously honest and caring human being, in thetrue sense, a public servant. In all the books and all the storiesI've read about him, I find no dark shadow in his closet.''   Lo Bianco's research took him to the LaGuardia archives in Queensto pore over their material and photographs to capture the man'sexpressions. He read books about the man as well as LaGuardia'sautobiography, ``The Insurgent.''   Still, it took the actor a while to decide to do the role. Heworried about not only having to capture the man's physicalmannerisms but the sound of his voice as well.   He would practice the voice every day at home. One day, when hiswife came home she thought there was an intruder in the apartment.It was Lo Bianco, changing into the character.   Now, before each performance, Lo Bianco listens to various taperecordings of LaGuardia's voice to keep in tune with his cadence andthe high pitch of his voice.   What sold him on the role was the man himself.   ``He was a human being who cared,'' Lo Bianco says. ``That kindof battler I love.''   The play begins on LaGuardia's last day in the mayor's office andflashes backward to his youth, to his days as a lawyer and acongressman when he upset the corrupt Democratic machine and wonelection as a Republican, and finally to his election as mayor.   The Brooklyn-born Lo Bianco doesn't remember LaGuardia butremembers his father, a taxi driver, remembering LaGuardia. Theactor recalls his parents' romanticized stories of the tough timesduring the Depression and at the center of these troubles wasLaGuardia. Now, his own passion for the man is just as fierce.   ``It's a cause,'' the actor says. ``I don't look at doing thisplay as just doing a play. It's more than that to me. What LaGuardiastood for _ truth, honesty and no corruption _ is something that weshould all aspire to live in our lives. He almost never leaves me. Ifeel it's as exciting for me to play the role as it was for him tobe mayor.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Veteran producer Roger L. Stevens says Broadwayis suffering from a severe shortage of good writers.   ``The good writers have gotten old and died, and television getsthe young ones before they develop their craft,'' he saysmatter-of-factly. ``There was a time in the 1950s when there mightbe 25 first-rate scripts floating about at any one time. Not anymlay in Paris, cast Mikhail Baryshnikov in thelead role. The play has broken the house record at the EthelBarrymore Theater.   ``It couldn't miss,'' Stevens says. ``Here is one of the mostfamous short stories of all time by one of the most famous authorsof all time, plus a superstar, all in one package.''   ``Metamorphosis'' and A.R. Gurney's hit ``The Cocktail Hour,''now playing off-Broadway, are Stevens' first New York shows sincehe retired last year as chairman of the board at the John F.Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. ``I spent thelast three years trying to give the position to somebody,'' hequips.   For 17 years, he headed the behemoth cultural institution whichwas originally proposed by President Kennedy in 1961 as theNational Cultural Center.   In the beginning, many in Congress were against the CulturalCenter, later named after the late president, but Stevenspersisted. He went from congressman to congressman to gain supportfor the project. Even after the gleaming white marble structureopened in the early '70s, he had to battle for money.   ``We were always so broke,'' Stevens recalls. ``We never got anygovernment money for productions.''   It was the center's involvement in such musicals as ``Pippin''and ``Annie'' that brought in money, plus Stevens' never-flaggingefforts to raise cash from private and corporate donors.   Stevens remains on the center's board of trustees and he hasn'tgiven up his other cultural jobs. Among his other duties are thechairmanship of the National Book Awards, membership on thePresident's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and foundingfather of the Fund for New American Plays.   Before Stevens entered the theater, he had been a successfulreal estate man. He headed a syndicate that bought and sold theEmpire State Building in the early 1950s and he also has extensivereal estate holdings in Seattle.   ``I never wanted to be a producer,'' Stevens says. ``I justwanted to get away from the real estate business.''   His first big commercial production, a musical version of``Peter Pan'' starring Jean Arthur and Boris Karloff in 1950, was ahit, and he was hooked.   ``If you have one big successful musical, you are set forlife,'' Stevens says.   Stevens' bonanza was ``West Side Story'' but, he recalls, theinitial response from investors was minimal.   ``I had to guarantee the money for the production on my own,''he says. ``I always knew it was going to be a hit, although nobodyelse thought so. I just thought, `How can we go wrong?' We had`Romeo and Juliet' plus Jerry Robbins doing the dances.''   Still, he has had his share of failures. Who remembers suchflops as ``Midgie Purvis,'' ``Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole,''``Everybody Loves Opal'' and a lot of others?   ``I expect them,'' Stevens says. ``It's the law of averages.Today, if one out of seven or eight works, you're doing well.''   His efforts to form what amounted to a national theater companyat the Kennedy Center under director Peter Sellars met with a lotof publicity but little success.   ``I don't think he had enough experience, especially in theateritself,'' Stevens says. ``Peter was very good with operas, butWashington just didn't seem to take to him. It was quite a surpriseto him when it didn't work.''   Where does Stevens look for new shows?   ``If you've been in the business as long as I have, you knowwhere all the authors are and what they're doing,'' he says. ``Butplays don't just come in to you like they used to. There are veryfew available plays that don't tell the same old story. You justhave to keep looking.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Nancy Dussault first saw ``Into the Woods,''the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical that opened on Broadwaymore than a year ago, she thought, ``Gee, I could do that.''   She could _ and eventually did.   In December, the buoyant musical comedy performer joined the castof the fairy tale musical as the Witch, a role originally played byBernadette Peters.   For Dussault, the show is something of a homecoming, a roundaboutreturn to the Broadway theater after several long side trips, mostlyto television where she co-hosted ``Good Morning America'' andappeared in the series ``Too Close for Comfort.''   Not that she was completely away from performing on the stage. Infact, when Dussault got the call for ``Into the Woods,'' she was inMichigan starring in a production of ``Follies,'' another Sondheimmusical. The actress didn't hesitate to come to New York for herfirst Broadway show in 10 years.   ``You don't get that many chances on Broadway anymore,'' shesays. ``Today, it's real hard. There's no place for kids to work.When they tell me, `I'm going into the musical theater,' my heartstops.''   Dussault had no such problems when she began her own career whichstarted in the mid-1950s with a high school production of``Brigadoon.'' The little girl with the big voice later attendedNorthwestern University as a music major and worked at a tenttheater in Highland Park, Ill., where one summer she did 12 shows.   ``We were so young,'' she recalls. ``What did we care how hard weworked. But we had real training.''   Every day meant four hours of singing drills, then stageexercises, improvisations, learning how to work so close to anaudience, and then lectures on grooming, makeup and weightmaintenance.   ``I got a great education in the etiquette of theater,'' Dussaultsays. ``It was so valuable.''   That education came in handy when she made her way to New Yorkand first made her name in small revues created by Julius Monk atthe famous Upstairs at the Downstairs.   ``I loved doing revues, two shows a night at $100 a week,'' shesays. ``When I look at `Saturday Night Live' I'm sorry I was just alittle too old when it started. You want someone who does all theaccents and the insanities and sings, even upside down? Whatever youwant, I can do it.''   Her big Broadway break came in 1960 when she played the ingenuein ``Do Re Mi,'' a musical that starred Phil Silvers. She won aTheater World award and was nominated for a Tony.   After that, she never stopped working in the theater, at leastwhile Broadway kept doing big musicals. But big shows became fewerand fewer.   ``I really thought I would always be able to make my living inthe theater,'' Dussault says. ``And I did for a long, long time.''   Eventually she realized that to be hired for the theater, you hadto have a name, and making a name meant California and television.   ``I had to go do that, and it made me desperately unhappy,''Dussault says. ``I just wanted to sing and dance. I grew up withthose kinds of movies. And I didn't understand the impact oftelevision. As it turned out, I like doing television a lot,especially the quickness of it.''   She plunged into TV, guest-starring on scores of televisionshows. Today, audiences remember her best as the original co-host on``Good Morning America'' and as Ted Knight's wife on ``Too Close forComfort'' for much of the 1980s. That job provided steadyemployment, lasting six years.   ``People criticized our show as a silly little sitcom,'' sherecalls. ``But I said, `No, we worked real hard, and we tried tomake it good.'''   In between, there were short tours or limited engagements eachyear in shows like ``I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It onthe Road'' or the Michigan engagement of ``Follies.'' But you can'tplay the ingenue forever, and those roles were for older women.   ``I'm very aware of how long I've been in the business and whatmy age is,'' she says. ``I'm not a child anymore. I know the rolesare changing for me. And I try not to be frightened by it.''   That's why she jumped at the chance to play the Witch in ``Intothe Woods.'' Besides Peters, such diverse actresses and singers asPhylicia Rashad of ``The Cosby Show'' and Cleo Laine have tackled it.   ``I kind of like coming into a show that's already running ratherthan go through all the rigamarole of getting a new musical on,''Dussault says.   Besides, the role gave her a chance to work with Sondheim, whowrote the music and lyrics for ``Into the Woods.''   ``He is our guiding light,'' she says. ``I don't quite know howto articulate it. I guess I think he's a genius. He has such passionfor his job, and he works at it so hard.   ``And he fortunately has gotten into a position when people willalways pay attention to what he is doing _ and rightly so. He'sunique.''   Sondheim went over the music with Dussault, explaining therhythms and the orchestrations, particularly how they work to conveyemotions.   What happens when her ``Into the Woods'' contract is up in sixmonths?   ``I've been threatening for years to do a one-woman show,''Dussault says. ``My biggest problem is trying to decide what thatwould be. Whether it should be a conglomeration of songs or have atheme. Either way, it's a lovely way to continue working in thetheater.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Yuriko, a Japanese-American dancer andchoreographer, and her daughter, Susan Kikuchi, met with JeromeRobbins in January 1988, they didn't realize their conversationwould be the beginning of a year-long project.   For mother and daughter, it meant a return to ``The King and I,''a musical both have been associated with much of their professionallives. For Robbins, it involved the chance to rework and refine oneof his most famous creations, ``The Small House of Uncle Thomas,'' aproduction number in ``The King and I.''   This ballet opens the second act of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,''a new, $7 million musical featuring numbers by the famed directorand choreographer. The show spans 20 years, beginning with Robbins'first show, ``On the Town,'' in 1944, and ending with his lastmusical, ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' in 1964.   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' required meticulous preparation _months of research and reconstruction of musical numbers, anunprecedented 22 weeks of rehearsal for its cast of more than 60dancers and singers, and seven weeks of preview performances beforethe opening.   The musical also includes such famous Robbins creations as thefrantic Mack Sennett ballet from ``High Button Shoes,'' ``I'mFlying'' from ``Peter Pan,'' a suite of dances from ``West SideStory'' and a trio of strippers proclaiming ``You Gotta Have aGimmick'' from ``Gypsy.''   Some musical numbers had to be re-created from scratch and thecollective memories of their original dancers. That wasn't the casewith ``The Small House of Uncle Thomas,'' which is from one ofRodgers and Hammerstein's best-known musicals.   Yuriko, a one-time member of the Martha Graham Dance Company,performed in the original 1951 cast of ``The King and I,'' whichstarred Gertrude Lawrence and Yul Brynner.   In the show, she played Eliza in ``The Small House of UncleThomas.'' The number is a Siamese dance re-telling of HarrietBeecher Stowe's ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' Now she has helped Robbinsre-create it, and Miss Kikuchi plays the role her mother originated38 years ago.   The ballet apparently was Hammerstein's idea. It's mentioned inan early version of the ``The King and I'' script. The general storyline for the ballet is in the script, as well as some narration andspecific ideas for the dance. Hammerstein even had the idea of usingreal dogs _ poodles, in fact _ to chase the ballet's heroine. Theynever made it to Robbins' final version.   Instead, Robbins created six distinct, separate dance segments totell the story of Eliza crossing the ice, her pursuit by SimonLegree, Legree's drowning and the death of Little Eva.   At first, the choreographer strove for a correct Oriental style.   ``He was into authenticity, trying to choreograph through that,''said Yuriko, recalling the intense four-week rehearsal period beforethe show went out of town in 1951. The dance style was modified asrehearsals went on, to accommodate Rodgers' music which was moreBroadway than Far Eastern.   In rehearsal, Robbins worked closely with Trude Rittman, whoarranged the dance music, incorporating some of Rodgers' melodies aswell as her own work. The music wasn't completed until Feb. 15,1951, 11 days before the show began its pre-Broadway tryout in NewHaven, Conn.   ``The music and the choreography went along side by side,''Yuriko says. ``They were created together.''   Yuriko remembers the choreography so well because she was thedance captain for the original production of ``The King and I.''   ``I had to know all the parts,'' she says. ``In my original musicscore, I have notes and have tried to preserve it as much as I can.''   Yuriko has directed or choreographed many revivals of ``The Kingand I,'' including the 1977 Brynner production that ran for morethan a year on Broadway. It was in that revival that Miss Kikuchidanced the role of Eliza.   Miss Kikuchi is a veteran of ``The King and I.'' As a child, shewatched her mother in the original production and joined variousrevivals of the show herself, eventually playing most of the rolesin ``The Small House of Uncle Thomas.''   ``My mother would take me into a room and just teach it to me,''Miss Kikuchi recalls.   Auditions for the new show began in February of last year. Yuriko_ and later Miss Kikuchi _ attended them and conferred with Robbinson his choices.   ``Jerry took his time picking people, dancers he thought he couldwork with,'' says Miss Kikuchi. ``He likes giving new, unexpecteddirections and having things accomplished right away.''   Robbins kept refining the choreography _ at one point, taking outa major sequence or experimenting with various ideas on how to makeit snow on stage. That effect, used in the original, was finallydropped.   Robbins has a reputation as a perfectionist.   ``You have to be able to have stamina,'' Yuriko says. ``You haveto be absolutely quick in changing from one minute to the next. Ifhe likes a dancer, he will start to needle a little bit, to see howquickly they can react to change.''   The long rehearsal process for the show hasn't been easy. Robbinsquickly replaced dancers if he found they were not working in aparticular number. The show is the bottom line.   ``He's looking for an intelligence and capability, not just to beable to do one step, polish it and get stuck there,'' Yuriko says.``He loves to change until it is right _ and only he knows what isright.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</NOTE><NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With a wicked smile and a wicked song,Christopher Mason lampoons the ladies and gents of the upper crust.   He sings about the foibles, follies and fads of high-powered,high-society folk like Ivana (Trump), Nancy (Reagan), David(Rockefeller), Brooke (Astor) and William (Paley). And they love it.   In less than two years, the sprite-like, 27-year-old Mason hasgone from private party entertainer to budding cabaret star. Nowhe's appearing through May at the fabled Oak Room in the AlgonquinHotel where he's singing not only about people like Mrs. Trump andher yacht and Mrs. Reagan and her new life in California, but aboutsuch topics as the water shortage and trash TV. He's a combinationof Cole Porter and Tom Lehrer with a bit of Noel Coward thrown infor good measure.   ``I write the words and the music. I play the piano and sing,''Mason explains. ``So if the evening is terrible, it's all myfault.''   It was never hard to get Mason to perform. He was born inEngland, the son of an opera singer and a civil servant. At the ageof 3, he saw ``The Sound of Music,'' came home, sat down at thepiano and played every song from the show _ with one finger.   ``I used to drive all of my piano teachers crazy because I'd beplaying Chopin or Beethoven, and I'd always think of what I thoughtwas a nicer way of finishing a phrase,'' he says, recalling hisprecocious childhood.   At Cambridge, Mason majored in English and art history, but whenhe came to New York, he worked long hours for little pay in publicrelations and fund-raising. But he got to observe the rich at closequarters. He also got to attend parties, lots of them.   ``When there was nothing left to revive a party, I was throwntoward the piano to play and sing,'' he says. ``People said, `Whydon't you do this all the time?'''   He finally did. His big break came last May when he was hired byfashion designer Mario ``the Prince of Chintz'' Buatta to play fora society dinner at the New York Public Library.   Mason wrote five new songs for the occasion. ``If you areburning with the love of learning, write a check to the publiclibrary,'' he crooned in his best fund-raising voice. But he alsowrote songs about Brooke Astor and Annette Reed, two of the biggestsupporters of the library. The ditties suggested that Mrs. Astorchange her first name from Brooke to Book and Mrs. Reed spell herlast name R-e-a-d.   Mason was a big success, and people began calling to ask if he'dappear at their parties, playing original songs.   ``I was terrified of asking for money,'' he says. ``I'm English,so I'm terrible at dealing with money.''   At first, Mason would immediately say yes to a job and then askabout the fee. Often it was less than $500. Today, he has an agentat William Morris and his price for an evening's work can go ashigh as $3,000.   He serenaded Mrs. Trump last summer aboard the Trump Princess,her husband's $30 million yacht.   Mason writes during regular, 9-to-5 office hours, but findspressure the best tonic for non-productivity.   ``The idea of a deadline and a check at the end of it isirresistible for writing new songs,'' he says.   Some of his best songs have been born on airplanes and trains.   For the reopening of Blair House in Washington, Mason wrote asong about it on a cocktail napkin, while he was flying from NewYork to the nation's capital.   And for his Algonquin engagement, Mason has written differenttypes of songs.   ``God knows, not everybody is interested in society'sdarlings,'' he says. ``So I've written a love song or two. As wellas one number about the former president called `The Reagans atHome in Bel Air.'''   Mason suddenly begins reciting:   ``The Secret Service is awfully nervous   ``They can't think what to do.   ``They are meant to take care of the Reagans   ``But the Reagans seem awfully blue.   ``They are finding it hard to adjust to being ordinary folk   ``And the pressure's not fair.   ``Though their friends bought them quite a swell house.   ``It's no fun being the Reagans at home in Bel Air.''   Mason also is working on a musical called ``How To Bag aBillionaire,'' a look at today's version of what used to be calledgolddiggers, those women who want to marry for money and notnecessarily love.   ``I'm selfishly writing the whole thing, the book and songs, butI won't be in it,'' he says.   The show has been delayed while Mason completes his Algonquinengagement, and he tries to juggle all his offers from the rich andthe famous.   ``I find myself now invited to all the big parties _ theserious, social parties, which is a peculiar thing,'' Mason says.``I spend time with these people. They must be aware that I amwatching them every second to see how they are behaving. Maybepeople think they are flirting with danger in a very acceptable wayby having me around.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A reporter's telephone call interrupted OtisButler's breakfast. He had been eating a tomato out of his freezer.   He'd grown it himself. In a garden carved out of a vacant lot _in the Bronx.   Otis Butler is a retired baker, and president of the UnionProspect Area Block Association. But when he talks tomatoes, hesounds like a farmer.   ``We need rain,'' he says. ``We had six weeks of hot weatherlast summer, hot and dry. It knocked our tomatoes down. We didn'teven enter the 58th Street horticulture fair, but when I sawtomatoes that won prizes, I said what the heck, our tomatoes are asgood as these. We could have won a prize.   ``Nobody had real good tomatoes last summer.''   An unlikely midmorning conversation, an unlikely farmer, talkingabout crops grown from seeds from an unlikely place: Theseed-jammed office of the America the Beautiful Fund in an agingoffice building a few blocks from the White House.   It may be the only office in Washington in which the top drawerof a green file cabinet is labeled ``Prairie Grass,'' the middledrawer is labeled ``Bulk Flowers and Muskmelon,'' the bottom draweris labeled ``Corn, Beans, Pea Packets.''   From these shoebox quarters, and operating on a shoestring, thefund distributes donated vegetable, herb and flower seeds and bulbsto local projects across America.   America the Beautiful Fund turns out to be four part-timeworkers, a handful of volunteers and a full-time staff of three _wildlife biologist Paul Bruce Dowling, founder and executivedirector; former actress Nanine Bilski, national projects director,and anthropologist Nat Thomas, who spends much of his time packingenvelopes with seed packets.   They are Johnny Appleseeds with a computer _ and a far broaderlist of seeds to give away. They figure their ``Operation GreenPlant'' reaches into one county in 10, maybe even one in three.   The idea is simplicity itself: Persuade a dozen of the nation'sseed companies to donate _ rather than destroy _ ``last year's''seeds, on the promise they will go only to people who would not bein a position to buy them at the corner hardware store.   Persuade APA Transport and other trucking companies to bring inthe seeds at no charge. Persuade local poverty agencies, 4-H clubs,church groups, neighborhood associations, refugee centers, drugrehabilitation centers, county health departments, soup kitchens,nursing homes _ even hospices for AIDS patients _ to start agardening project. Charge them only the cost of shipping the seeds_ 50 cents a pound.   For $12 in shipping fees, a group could get enough seed to growtwo acres of tomatoes and one acre each of corn, lettuce,cucumbers, green peppers and squash.   The idea started in 1980 with 60 beautification projects. Ittook off when the new environmental ethic matched up with thenation's dawning awareness that there was hunger on the streetcorners, in the small towns and even on the farms of thisprosperous, fertile and sometimes over-fed land.   Last season, 15,000 groups asked for, received and distributed500,000 packets of seeds and 50,000 pounds of bulk seeds.   That's enough, Dowling estimates, to provide ``over 70 millionpounds of fresh, nutritious food, grown by and for hungry people atthe cost of a penny a pound.''   ``It is an idea so simple and so basic that it works,'' he says.   The value of the food grown last year, by Dowling'sseat-of-the-pants estimate, is $20 million.   This year, those figures will double, Dowling and Ms. Bilskiconfidently predict. They should know. Much of the seeds for thisspring's planting already have been shipped.	</TEXT><NOTE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><TEXT>   A Texas teen-ager getting ready for the Junior Livestock Showhad some thoughts about petulant porkers.   ``Raising a pig is good fun, but how much fun depends on themood of the pig,'' Jenny Haley told the Anvil Herald of Hondo,Texas.   A great-grandmother in West Virginia, egged on by agranddaughter-in-law, finally got around to earning a high schooldiploma.   ``I dreaded math the most,'' Dorothy Johns, 71, of Gay, W.Va.,told the Ravenswood (W.Va.) News.   When the 91-year-old founder of an egg and poultry company inElectra, Texas, died, his obituary in the San Saba (Texas) Newsmatter-of-factly noted that he was born in Indian Territory and asa child was brought across the Red River in a covered wagon.   In the Bonners Ferry Herald, which has served Boundary County,Idaho, since 1891, columnist Grace Bauman offered this observation:``If you think you're getting too much government, just be thankfulyou're not getting as much as you're paying for.''   Headline from the Meade County Messenger of Brandenburg, Ky.:``Rabies cases fewer, but stay alert.''   So it goes in the American countryside. While Washingtonconcerned itself with the insolvency of the S&amp;Ls and the sobrietyof John Tower, the topic of the Tri-State Cow-Calf Symposium atHaigler, Neb. was closer to home _ ``Producing the Cow of theFuture Today.''   There are things to learn about the state of the nation fromAmerica's 7,498 weeklies that you won't find in the CongressionalRecord.   Sure, there's some bad news:   The taxpayers of Clinton County, Mo., may be stuck with the$20,000 medical bill resulting from the amputation of both legs ofa suspect who escaped from the county jail and suffered severefrostbite while at large, says the Lawson (Mo.) Review.   The Osawatomie (Kan.) Graphic worries that Osawatomie'sreputation as a railroad town may be slipping; the Union Pacific isthinking about routing even fewer trains through town.   Drugs worry the countryside, as they do the big cities. Schoolsget consolidated, young people leave, industries close. The bigdrought of 1988 still takes its toll: still not enough rain in lotsof places, not enough snow cover for the winter wheat.   ``Hunters are finding fewer rabbits and quail than usual inKentucky this season,'' reports the Bath County News-Outlook ofOwingsville, Ky. Blame the drought, says Jeff Sole of the KentuckyDepartment of Fish and Wildlife Resources.   But for all that, the weeklies report the news that tells youthe heart of America is still ticking. Important news, because,after all, doesn't everyone come from a small town, or think hedid, or wish he had?   In that case, here's some of the news from back home:   Wallace Wyatt Jr. promised that if he were elected probate judgeof St. Clair County, Ala., he would eat a super-hot barbecuesandwich at Smitty's Barb-B-Que in Odenville, Ala. He was, so hedid. ``He said he wouldn't do it again for $500, and it wasn'tsomething he'd wish on anyone, even a Republican,'' said the St.Clair News-Aegis.   Working on a master's degree, Melanie Reid of Due West, S.C.,researched the history of the Opera House which opened inAbbeville, S.C., in 1908 and put the lie to some local legends. Noevidence at all, she told the Abbeville Press and Banner, thatJimmy Durante, Sarah Bernhardt or the Ziegfield Follies everperformed there.   In Oconomowoc, Wis., high school football player Rich Andrus wassuccessfully recruited by the University of Wisconsin. Head coachDon Morton and an assistant called on him on the first day homevisits were permitted. Exactly when did they arrive?``Twelve-oh-one a.m.,'' Andrus told the Oconomowoc Enterprise. Hesaid such tenacity was ``pretty impressive.''   The Enterprise also reported that people from the Oconomowocarea drove in four trucks for 4{ hours to deliver food, clothes andpaper products to farmers from northern Wisconsin still sufferingfrom the effects of last summer's drought. The farm families needwork clothes, said Mrs. Gerhart Tetzlaff of Stone Bank, but theyespecially need food. ``I think they are so hungry they don't careabout clothes.''   The Garden Club of Stamford, Texas, celebrated the 100thanniversary of Texas Arbor Day by planting two pecan trees on thewest side of Post Office Square as a memorial to Mrs. A.C. Denson,longtime member of the club ``who, had she lived another month,would also have been 100 years old,'' the Stamford American said.	</TEXT><NOTE>By MIKE HENDRICKS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States Military Academy islegendary for producing such all-American war heroes as Ulysses S.Grant, Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower. But the``country'' in West Point's motto ``Duty, Honor, Country'' does notnecessarily mean the United States.   For the past century, West Point has also been a training groundfor future generals of foreign armies _ dictatorships as well asdemocracies.   Soldiers like Filipino General Fidel Ramos, the late Nicaraguandictator Anastasio Somoza and pre-revolutionary Chinese Army Gen.Ying Hsing Wen marched out of West Point's storied Long Gray Line toplay key historical roles.   This year's foreign plebes come from Bolivia, Guatemala, Lebanon,Liberia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Malawi, Singapore, Jordan,Turkey and Zimbabwe. Currently, 30 foreign cadets are training atWest Point from Bangladesh, Haiti, Senegal, Cameroon, Liberia andBotswana among other places.   Once approved by the secretary of defense, a nation's politics orrelations with the United States are not considered in judging anapplicant's merits, says Capt. Robin Carrington, admissions officerfor foreign cadets.   ``We do not deal with philosophy,'' Carrington says. ``We try tokeep standards for foreign cadets exactly the same as U.S.citizens.''   There are cadets from countries ruled by hard-line dictators whodo not tolerate dissent or hold elections, as well as from countrieswith democratic governments like that of the United States.   The purpose of educating foreign cadets at West Point, accordingto a Congressional report, is to build good will and expose futureforeign military leaders to American ideals, especially indeveloping nations where the United States seeks to promotestability.   Annapolis and the Air Force Academy have similar programs. Bylaw, each military academy is allowed 40 foreign cadets at a time.At the moment, the Air Force Academy has 37 and the Navy academy, 32.   ``Our goal is to provide an opportunity for students fromselected countries to attend the Air Force Academy and learn moreabout the way we do business in this country and go back home with afirst-rate military education and hopefully be better allies,'' saysLt. Col. John Swiney, associate director of admissions at the U.S.Air Force Academy.   Fidel Ramos graduated from West Point with honors in 1950.Thirty-six years later, he played a pivotal role in the revolt thatended Ferdinand E. Marcos' 20-year reign in the Philippines and putCorey Aquino in power.   Ramos developed friendships with West Point classmates who wenton to powerful posts in the U.S. military, including CharlesGabriel, an Air Force chief of staff, and John Wickham, who becamethe U.S. Army's chief of staff.   Ramos is now Philippine defense secretary and one of hiscountry's most popular figures. A veteran of the Korean and Vietnamwars, Ramos is using his education to fight a communist insurgencyand quell coups in the Philippines.   Natee Wongissares, a senior from Bangkok, Thailand, agrees thatboth countries have benefited from Thailand's cadets at West Point.   ``In the future these people (West Point graduates) have atendency toward the United States,'' the Thai cadet says. ``They canaffect the relationship between the two countries for a betterrelationship, they will work together.''   Unstable political climates in some Third World countries, wherechange is more apt to take the form of a coup than a democraticvote, have created unusual situations for West Point graduates.   Capt. Moises Cortizo, Class of 1980, is a loyal aide toPanamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, at odds with the UnitedStates since his indictment by an American grand jury on drugtrafficking charges last year.   Ricardo Ernesto Castro, Class of 1973, sought political asylum inthe United States after testifying before Congress about hisactivities as a leader of a Salvadoran death squad.   Anastasio Debayle Somoza, son of the original Nicaraguan dictatorAnastasio Somoza, was given command of the Nicaraguan national guardwhen he graduated from West Point in 1946. He went on to succeed hisfather as president before the Sandinista Revolution ended thatregime.   West Point's first foreign cadets came from South America, butthe program has expanded virtually worldwide. Countries with cadetsat West Point are no longer necessarily U.S. allies.   Soviet cadets may enter West Point classrooms next fall under aprogram approved by the Reagan administration allowing West Pointand Soviet military academies to exchange cadets for two-week visits.   American cadets also have the opportunity to spend two weeks at aforeign military academy in one of more than 30 countries includingVenezuela, Jordan, Belgium, Morocco, the Dominican Republic andJapan.   Of more than 70 nations invited, 25 to 30 send applications. Manyof America's strongest allies do not send cadets to West Point. NATOmember countries are invited but don't participate, although aCanadian midshipman is attending the Naval Academy.   Foreign cadets don't compete against American candidates, saysacademy spokeswoman Andrea Hamburger. ``These spaces arespecifically designated for non-American cadets. They have to meetthe same basic criteria as a cadet here would.''   At West Point all cadets eat the same food, adhere to the samedress code, take the same courses and meet the same requirements forgraduation.   In addition to chemistry, engineering, and science courses, theycan study the history of technology and warfare, the Americanexperience in Korea and Vietnam, space mechanics, terrain analysis,military computer systems, military ethics and nuclear reactordesign.   ``They are usually very, very serious students and good students.Depending on where they are from, some struggle with English,'' saysCarrington.   Some have more than a language barrier to overcome.   Carrington recalls one cadet from an African tribe who had neverflown on an airplane until he came to West Point. He had only heardabout water coming out of the walls, but had never seen or taken ashower and had to be shown how to drink out of a soda can.   ``There is some culture shock, especially in the beginning,''Carrington says.   Otherwise, foreign cadets are not so different from American boyswho grow up dreaming of going to West Point.   In Bangkok, Natee Wongissares dreamed of becoming a West Pointcadet. ``It was my life goal since I was 12 to get to West Point,''he says. ``Since I saw a movie about Eisenhower when he was ageneral I wanted to be just like him.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citizens can now buy a Europillow,emblazoned with a circle of 12 gold stars on royal blue, butfounding fathers are tossing fitfully over their dream of a singleEurope.   Halfway between the Single European Act of 1986 and the targetdate of Jan. 1, 1993, European Economic Community officials insistthey can blur internal borders enough to forge economic union.   But few people are talking about a United States of Europe, insharp contrast to the first days of Europhoria.   In full flower, the dream was to spring beyond economics to ablend of social philosophy, public policy and shared culture thatcreated a new extranational being, the European.   Reality has muscled aside rhetoric.   At Cafe des Amis in London, on the surface a sign of culturalshift, a French waiter was asked what coffee he had. ``Espresso,cappuccino and,'' he concluded with a sharp sniff, ``English soup.''   Early this year, the EEC Commission president, Jacques Delors,exhorted the European Parliament: ``We must give this communitymore flesh and _ why not? _ a measure of soul.''   But he has toned down the enthusiasm that prompted PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher of Britain to remind him, in a stingingspeech, that concepts like ``social gains'' were not on the table.   ``There is no question of a new personality replacing individualcultures,'' said Pascal Lamy, chief aide to Delors.   Three-quarters of Britons and Italians speak no second tongue,EEC figures show. Community business is done in nine languages. Inmost of the 12 countries, the predominant second culture isAmerican.   The process was never supposed to be quick, but officials nowtalk in terms of generations. Lord Young, British secretary ofstate for trade and industry, suggests 500 years.   Even such tangible second-stage aspects as a harmonized foreignpolicy seem beyond reach in light of acrimony over the fundamentalsof national currencies, border controls and tax policies.   Britain recently bounced back Delors' plan for a monetary unionto take measured steps toward a common currency.   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government also rejected talk ofuniform workers' rights and labor practices, calling that athrowback to the 1970s.   But President Francois Mitterrand of France, a Socialist,earlier this year defined ``backward'' as refusing to protect wagesand workers.   ``The most regressive and unjust laws must not prevail,'' hetold a crowd. ``France will not give its consent.''   Out of the public eye, officials struggle to balance sales taxeswhich now vary from 0 to 38 percent, a prerequisite to open borders.   An even greater obstacle to free movement are concerns forsecurity, especially in Britain and France where authorities watchclosely for possible terrorists or drug runners.   ``The last time I went through British customs they took my carapart like a bloody Lego toy,'' observed Val Gardner, a Britishmotor engineer living in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. `'That isnot likely to change.''   Few leaders are prepared to entrust security to any form of EECpolice force, which, in any case, could not be established withoutcomplex new jurisdictional accords.   Enthusiasm is mixed for the basic idea among EEC members, andeach is coolly assessing what it stands to lose. Every politicianknows, whatever his stance in Brussels, he faces voters at home.   A museum tour of any European capital shows the vast culturalwealth behind the dream, a shared sense of pride in the art,literature and music which shaped the Western world.   But a glance at the daily headlines suggests that a millenium ofconflict has merely been refined by modern times.   In April, for example, the annual French yacht race across theAtlantic was stalled by fishermen in the port of Lorient demandingthat a warship chase off an interloping Spanish fleet.   The Greens, a loose amalgam of European ecologist parties, aregaining fast on platforms that argue the single market will smashflat all the bumps and edges that make up European life.   They warn that small farmers and businessmen will perish if theycling to traditional ways _ or even if they try to keep up, in manycases.   ``They tell us we will gain 5 million jobs, but we'll lose 20million,'' German candidate Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorftold the Greens' congress in Paris to a tumult of applause.	</TEXT><NOTE>By NANCY SHULINS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It might have been the effects ofpainkillers that changed Steve Price's life. It might have been asurge of bioenergy that some mystics believe lies dormant in us all.   Then again, it maatever it was that kept Price from firing his gunagain afterhe was nearly killed by a mortar fragment in Vietnam in 1965 hasnever been measured or analyzed or scanned. No one knows, so anytheory could apply.   Regardless, Price's near-death experience continues to shape hislife years later. The same holds true for many of the 8 millionAmericans who claim to know from experience what it feels like todie.   Nine years after her near-death experience, Barbara Harris walkedaway from her husband and three kids. She couldn't reconcile herprivileged lifestyle with a need to help others that was born whenher life flashed before her, revealing each ripple her actions hadcaused in the lives of others.   Just as many people can't remember their dreams, the majority ofpeople who come close to death don't recall it. But the 25 percentto 30 percent who do invariably give similar descriptions.   Near-death experiencers tell of disembodied travels through darktunnels at immeasurable speeds; of being bathed in a brilliant whiteor golden light that conveys feelings of peace and love far beyondany earthly emotion; of seeing the minutiae of their lives replayedfor their edification.   Some report joyful reunions with deceased loved ones whocommunicate telepathically. Others tell of encounters with a divinepresence or energy force they describe as the source of all love; ofcomprehending, for a mind-reeling instant, the secrets of theuniverse; of the anguish and sorrow that accompanies their reluctantreturn to the living.   The descriptions are similar in India and Japan, with culturalvariations; a Buddhist won't see Jesus, for example. PsychoanalystKarl Jung had a near-death experience in the mid-1940s. Englishphilosopher Sir Alfred J. Ayer, one of the world's prominentatheists, had one just last year. (Ayer wrote that it ``slightlyweakened my conviction that my genuine death, which is due fairlysoon, will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it willbe.'')   The scientists who study NDEs haven't been lucky enough to bearound during one, so they can only chronicle the effects. NDErsinvariably profess to have lost all fear of death. Many feel angryand disappointed at being revived. ``I felt so restricted, sotrapped in this body,'' says Al Sullivan of East Hartford, whose NDEcame during his heart surgery last year.   But even those whose NDEs resulted from suicide attempts seldomtry to return. ``The things that made people suicidal before are nolonger meaningful,'' says Bruce Greyson, a psychiatry professor atthe University of Connecticut Medical Center who has interviewedthousands of NDErs over 15 years of study. ``People see their rolein the universe-at-large. They see why they're here _ to take careof a family, raise a child, write a book.''   Virtually all NDErs emerge with an unwavering belief in a higherpower, regardless of their prior convictions. At the same time,organized religion tends to lose its meaning.   ``The God I met loves everyone. It's generic,'' says KateValentine of Oxford, Conn. A Catholic before her 1981 NDE, ``I'vebecome very unreligious.''   Many adopt less materialistic lives, and a large number changecareers, often becoming nurses, volunteers or social workers.   ``If a person was very materialistic before, his whole life maybe disrupted,'' Greyson says. ``Relationships often break up,especially if they were based on materialism and power. For asuccessful businessman, that could mean not being able to return tothe job.''   Kenneth Ring, a professor of psychology at the University ofConnecticut at Storrs, has studied NDEs since 1976 and has writtentwo books on the subject. ``People become life appreciators,'' hesays. ``They don't care about success, fame or fortune. They want tosail their boats on Long Island Sound.''   NDErs often develop a deep hunger for spiritual understanding,along with a fervent desire to see world conditions improve. Theytend to become more self-confident and less passive. Often, theylike themselves better.   ``I do miss financial security, but what really matters islove,'' says Harris, 46, whose NDE followed back surgery in 1975.Complications set in, her condition deteriorated, and Harris passedout in her bed.   She came to in the hospital corridor.   ``I turned to go back into my room _ my first thought was thatI'd get in trouble for being out of bed. Then I discovered I waslooking directly into a speaker that was mounted on the ceiling.''   Confusion _ ``If I'm here, what's in the bed?'' _ soon gave wayto pure sensation. ``I felt my grandmother holding me, cradlingme.'' The feeling was so soothing, so familiar, that moments passedbefore Harris remembered her grandmother had been dead for 10 years.   She returned to her body, but a week later, still bedridden, shehad a vision. ``I drew out of my body and relived my life _ all 32years _ in an instant.   ``I heard myself saying, `No wonder. No wonder you are the wayyou are.' I felt all the slates being wiped clean. I understood thereasons behind everything that had ever happened to me. It was themost healing therapy there could be.''   The Barbara Harris who entered the hospital had filled her dayswith garden club meetings. The one who left felt drawn to hospitalemergency rooms. She became a hospital volunteer, then a respiratoryand massage therapist.   Ultimately, Harris packed her clothes and her stereo into herSaab and drove away from her home, backyard pool and private plane.Now she rents a tiny apartment in Newington, which she shares withtwo of her children.   She addresses nurses, clergy and others who counsel the dying,and volunteers as Greyson's research assistant. She also leadsmonthly meetings of one of the two dozen NDE support groups thathave sprung up around the nation.   An NDEr's need for support is enormous, says Harris. ``You can'tstay the way you are, and your loved ones don't want you to change.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By NANCY SHULINS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's only fitting that Rajan's story beginwith a number: MYX1689, the number that started it all.   MYX554 was the license plate on the second car that pulled up tothe house in Mangalore, India, where his parents were having aparty. MYX558 was the third.   Some other 5-year-old might have sung a song or passed horsd'oeuvres to show off to the grownups: Rajan Srinivasen Mahadevanrecited the license plates of all 40 cars in the order in whichthey'd been parked.   That was the first anyone knew of Rajan Mahadevan's astonishingmemory. Twenty-seven years later, millions know of it, and there aredays when he wishes he had sung a song or passed hors d'oeuvres.   A memory that can hold fast to 31,811 random numbers yetpersistently misplace keys is a curious thing, a wondrous odditythat can bring opportunity, fame _ perhaps even immortality _ to itsowner.   But what of the other things a man has _ humor, creativity,intellect? ``This damn thing overpowers everything else, to apoint,'' Rajan says.   As a child, he says in the fluid, accented English he was raisedwith, ``I used to be so lost in my own thoughts, I would talk tomyself. It was hard to fit in. Other kids didn't know what to makeof me.''   Rajan's memory was not unexpected. ``It's like John Lennon's sonand music,'' he says. His father, a prominent surgeon, knows all2,156 lines of William Shakespeare's 154 sonnets.   ``I was expected to make it big in life. But my academic careerwas like the drawing of a mountain range.''   Rajan tried engineering and business administration, but felt noaffinity for either. Then someone suggested he put his memory to thetest, by trying to win a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.   He began studying a computer printout of the first 200,000 placesof pi, the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle.The ultimate test of numerical memory, pi begins 3.14159, thencontinues on indefinitely with no known duplication or pattern. TwoColumbia University mathematicians recently calculated pi to 480million decimal places.   On June 12, 1980, Rajan flew to Chicago, where he stunned thefifth International Congress on Yoga and Meditation by reciting thefirst 10,000 numbers.   On July 5, 1981, he stood before a capacity crowd in a Mangaloremeeting hall and rattled off numbers so quickly the judges couldbarely keep up. For three hours and 49 minutes, his memory neverfaltered. Then, finally, a lapse: He forgot the 31,812th digit of pi_ a 5.   Never mind. The record _ 20,013 _ had toppled. ``On Feb. 16,1983, I saw my name in the Book of Records, and I relaxed. That wasthe argument stopper. Until then, people could say, `So you have agood memory, so what?'   ``But from 1981 to 1987, I was the best in the world.''   In 1987, that honor went to Hideaki Tomoyori of Japan forreciting 40,000 digits in 17 hours, 21 minutes.   Still, memory expert Charles Thompson, a Kansas State Universitypsychology professor, is convinced Rajan's memory is superior. ``TheJapanese guy made up a story, a mnemonic, to help him remember thenumbers. His memory isn't as good.''   In the lab where Thompson is studying Rajan's memory, numbersflash past on a computer screen, one per second, and Rajan respondsas if to music. He taps his feet and rocks rhythmically back andforth in his chair. Now and then he jiggles his legs.   ``There's something about the way the numbers sound,'' he says.``It's not the way they look, it's the way they sound.''   For example, Rajan finds the numbers in pi from the 2,901th to3,000th places _ 81911979399520614196 and so on _ particularlymelodic. The series between 3,701 to 3,800 _ beginning 2332609729 _is ``very jarring.''   ``Just as you can't describe how you remember your phone number,neither can Rajan describe the process by which he remembers pi,''says Thompson, who has been trying since January to figure it out,along with Jerome Frieman, an animal behaviorist, and ThaddeusCowan, a cognitive psychologist.   ``The first time we tested him, we said, `Oh my God!''' Thompsonthinks Rajan may have the most remarkable numerical memory known toscience since ``S,'' a patient immortalized in clinical literatureby A.R. Luria, the Soviet psychologist who studied him for nearly 30years.   ``S'' was S.V. Shereshevskii, a Soviet newspaper reporter whosememory was discovered during the mid-1920s by an editor infuriatedby his failure to take notes. ``S'' didn't need to; he recalledeverything he'd ever seen or heard.   What he couldn't do was forget. Ultimately, unable to distinguishbetween conversations he'd heard five minutes or five years before,``S'' wound up in an asylum.   Rajan's memory is exceptional only for numbers. In all otherareas _ names, faces, words _ it is average. And unlike ``S,'' hecan forget, although ``it is hard to willfully forget numbers.''Random numbers memorized one session come flooding back duringanother. Keeping the sequences straight requires discipline andconcentration.	</TEXT><NOTE>By NANCY SHULINS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At a clinic in a small stucco house near theUniversity of Minnesota, doctors make a point of wearing streetclothes instead of white coats, and patient files are stored in abank vault.   Medical instruments are kept out of sight, along with scissorsand other sharp objects. A psychologist may counsel a patient oneday and take him to the dentist the next; the whine of a drill orsight of a needle can cause terror.   This is a story about people whose personalities have been takenapart, piece by piece, and the people who try to put them backtogether. The stucco house with its mismatched furniture, colorfulartwork and donated plants is the Center for Victims of Torture,the nation's most ambitious attempt to rehabilitate torturesurvivors.   The psychologists, doctors and others who work here face adistinct disadvantage: Torture is ancient, but this is a sciencestill inventing itself. ``We are designing the car while riding init,'' Linda Valerian says.   Though still a long way from the research, training, treatmentand education institute envisioned by a governor's task force, theprivate, non-profit center already is looked to for leadership by adozen groups trying to launch similar programs in Los Angeles, SanFrancisco and Elizabeth, N.J. In June, representatives of eachgroup will travel to Minneapolis for four days of workshops.   The conference will focus on treatment of trauma because medicalresearch on torture survivors has yet to be done. The 10 doctors,psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers at the Minneapolisoutpatient clinic have borrowed from the treatment of rape victims,Vietnam veterans and others.   Executive director Douglas Johnson thinks torture victims aremore profoundly damaged by their experience. ``If you were raped ormugged, you would still have some hope of rescue,'' he says. ``Butbeing tortured by your government means losing all recourse.There's a sense of abandonment to evil.''   Nearly three-fourths of the center's clients suffer frompost-traumatic stress disorder, the disease of combat soldiers,rape victims and earthquake survivors. Symptoms include nightmares,flashbacks, loss of memory, inability to concentrate, anduncontrollable outbursts of anger.   In the beginning, client assessments were kept to a minimum, forfear that too many questions would trigger memories ofinterrogation. ``For most people though, we've found the processwas actually comforting,'' says Johnson, whose staff has beguncompiling information as a prelude to serious research. The centeralso is raising money to renovate a much larger building the stateis donating to enable the program to expand.   So far, 147 survivors and their relatives have been treated atthe center. They have come from 21 countries, including Cambodia,Ethiopia, South Africa, El Salvador, Honduras, Iran and Vietnam.Eventually, the center hopes to treat 100 a year.   Nearly all now live in Minnesota. With its myriad church andstate refugee programs, the state has the highest per capitarefugee population in the nation: 39,000 out of 6 millionresidents, not counting Central American and other illegal aliens.All told, Johnson thinks there could be as many as 6,000 torturesurvivors among them. Los Angeles could have 50,000 or more, hesays.   Minnesota's clinic, established with the help of Gov. RudyPerpich in 1985, is one of two full-service torture-treatmentfacilities in the United States. Chicago's Marjorie Kovler Centerfor the Treatment of Survivors of Torture opened in 1987, fiveyears after Copenhagen established the first center. Others areoperating in Toronto and Paris.   Typically, anywhere from one to 10 years pass before a clientfinds his way to Minneapolis for treatment. The physical evidencemay be long gone, but the invisible, psychic wounds have yet toheal.   The victims' initial interview with Barbara Chester, theclinical director, may mark the first time they have ever discussedtheir experience. Some have trouble remembering; others can bringthemselves to speak of it only in the third person, relaying talesof horror that happened to ``others.''   ``It's hard for a nation of Donahue-watchers to understand thereticence of torture survivors,'' says Chester, a psychologist.``In the Third World, life is much more personal. Some things aresimply not talked about.''   Women who were sexually abused by their captors may viewthemselves as pariahs, she says. ``There's also the stigma that youmust have told them something, you must have joined the enemy, tobe still alive.''   Torture victims may not see the connection between the beatingsof three years ago and the anxieties of today. But such delaysaren't unusual. ``You're so busy surviving, it may not be until yourest for a moment that this comes out,'' Chester says.   Center physician Neal Holtan has learned not to mince words: ``Imay ask point-blank if they've ever been tortured.'' Often, evenwhen the answer is yes, the response is an unequivocal no. In someof the world's prisons, he says, ``it's considered normal to bebeaten up every day.''   When the long-repressed symptoms do surface, the most mundaneencounters, the most common objects, can cause panic. ``A knock onthe door, a ring of a bell, the turning on of a light bulb cantrigger bad memories,'' says University of Minnesota law professorDavid Weissbrodt, a board member of both Amnesty International andthe center.   Center staffers wear street clothes because many clients areafraid of uniforms. ``Even the sight of a mailman can upset them,''Chester says.   For clients' protection, files are stored in a bank vault. Fortheir comfort, the stucco house is unmarked. And when the centeropened, four Buddhist monks ceremoniously chased evil spirits outof each room.   Psychologist Rosa Garcia-Peltoniemi and her colleagues probegently. ``We are careful not to play the role of interrogator, andwe watch out for anything institutional in the atmosphere of theplace.'' She looks at her donated office furniture and sighs. ``Iworry that my chairs are too drab.''   Garcia-Peltoniemi, who came to America as a Cuban refugee in1970, is especially attuned to her clients' adjustment problems. Intheir native countries, they may have been students, professionalsor tribesmen. In America, they lose those identities.   ``Refugees in America are also exposed to more risk than theaverage person,'' she says. ``They may live in poor neighborhoodswith drugs, crime, assaults. For refugees who've been traumatized,another incident can have a powerful effect.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By NANCY SHULINS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Transforming an ordinary citizen into askilled torturer is easier than one might think, says a longtimeAmnesty International volunteer.   Linda Valerian, who is also a fund-raiser and coordinator ofvolunteers for Minnesota's Center for Victims of Torture, hastestified at immigration hearings as an expert witness on humanrights abuses. She gained some of her insights from a formerSalvadoran torturer, whom she interviewed at length.   Valerian remembers him as ``charming and likable. He was mostconcerned that I would be upset by what he had to say.'' Thetorturer, who'd escaped to the United States, agreed to beinterviewed to clear his conscience, she says.   His recruiters used a common technique. ``Part of the traininginvolved propaganda induction sessions,'' Valerian says. ``He'dbeen told that World War III had started. Communists were secretlyinfiltrating the country, using it as a beachhead to take over theWestern world.   ``It was imperative that he be made to believe these people wereholding the fate of the Western world in their hands.''   In reality, the victims had been chosen at random, Valeriansays. ``He saw elderly men, pregnant women and kids. Still, he hadno idea they weren't communists.''   As part of his indoctrination, the torturer was himself tortured.   ``The torturers are often beaten three times a day, sexuallyhumiliated and punished arbitrarily,'' Valerian says. ``Thisnormalization of violence is the key. The training lasts ninemonths. This man from the back of his waist to his knees was onegiant callus from canings with broom handles.''   At the same time new recruits are being beaten, Valerian says,``they're taught that they're the ones who are informed as towhat's really going on. They're the elite.   ``There are people who do enjoy it. There's the power. Theperks. The promise of a job for life. They're given cars. Andthey're paid very well, with liquor and drugs for the asking. A lotof the torture is done under the influence.''   The Salvadoran came from a family of 14 in a rural area. ``Theywere very poor and always hungry,'' Valerian says.   For a time, he did all that was asked of him. ``He finally beganto wonder when one of his superiors told him to cut the head offthe body of someone they'd murdered and place it on his body as awarning to others,'' Valerian says. ``He couldn't do it. Hecouldn't bring himself to mutilate a dead body.''   Then he saw a commanding officer cut the finger off a corpse _he wanted the dead man's ring.   ``He said, `That's crazy. We're acting like animals.''' Valeriansays. ``He escaped the next day.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By NANCY SHULINS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mike and Harry Dutchburn shared a life aspredictable as January's blizzards and July's blackberries.   Awake by 4 and asleep by 9. Off to the barn at 4, 2 and 5.Errands once a week: St. Albans for parts, Newport for fertilizer,John Deuso's store at the crossroads for potatoes, hot dogs andbread.   In a weather-beaten farmhouse on a lonely stretch of highway 10miles from Canada, the brothers passed their evenings in unmatchedarmchairs in a kitchen papered with sailing ships and maps of theworld.   The wallpaper was hung by a sister years ago. Mike, 77, andHarry, 79, likely would have chosen pictures of cows over maps of aworld they've had precious little to do with, until it burst in onthem one January night.   Anyone in town can point out the Dutchburn place, with itsblistered white paint and drawn shades. Surrounded by open fields,house and barn sit near the road on a curve that's unexpectedlytricky. Mike and Harry have lost track of the cars they've pulledfrom the mud over the years, a habit of helpfulness that was to costthem.   From their kitchen window, they can see their hillsidebirthplace, the only other home they've ever known. They stillremember moving day, June 15, 1915, just as they do every journeyaway from home ever since: their brother's funeral in Massachusettsin 1944; Mike's trip to their sister's in Michigan in 1960; the65-mile drive with their niece, Sandra Lyon, to Burlington a yearand a half ago. Harry hadn't been there for 40 years.   Except for pies and cookies from Grandma's Bakery in Richford,the Dutchburns' list of indulgences is shorter than the list oftheir trips: an aborted attempt at cigar-smoking in 1940 (Harry),and two chug-a-lugged bottles of gin in 1939 (Mike).   ``We don't owe anybody,'' says Mike. ``We pay cash or we dowithout. We go right along. That's our way.''   The Dutchburns' ways _ modesty, hard work and thrift _ werecommon knowledge on the frugal little farms of Franklin County. Sowas their habit of carrying large sums of cash.   On the last day of January 1986, the ways of the world _violence, cruelty and greed _ were brought home to the Dutchburns bytwo strangers who called them by name.   They pretended to be out of gas. The Dutchburns didn't have any,but Mike climbed out of his narrow iron bed in the middle of thenight. By the time he'd walked the few steps to the kitchen, the twomen had kicked in the door.   ``You shouldn't be here,'' Mike told them. He got hit in the face.   Harry, who had $7,000 in his shirt pocket, walked in right behindhim and got hit in the head with the thick maple cane he used toprod cows.   Mike put up a fight, but it was over in less than five minutes.Afterward, Mike says, ``the kitchen looked like you'd cut a bunch ofhens' heads off and let 'em fly.''   Five minutes was all it took to teach two old men about fear. Thefear never left them, not even after the robbers went to jail.   ``I don't sleep anymore. I hear the cars all night. You don'tforget it,'' says Mike. He only has to look at his brother toremember. Harry's right eye hangs like a crooked picture in hisface. It swells and weeps in the cold; since the beating, he nolonger goes out to do chores.   The cane hanging on its peg is another reminder. So are the dentsit left in the old Kelvinator in the kitchen. ``They could havetaken the money,'' Mike says. ``There's no sense beating a personup.''   He rubs the dents gently. ``It's the people in the world that'schanged,'' he says. ``They don't care who they take from.''   Detective Sgt. Bill Northrup, an 18-year veteran of the VermontState Police, calls it ``as brutal as any homicide I've everinvestigated.''   Except that it wasn't a homicide. The Dutchburns survived.   They just didn't recover.   Mike Dutchburn lay for 3{ hours on the kitchen floor after thebeating, afraid to move. Harry was unconscious. When Mike saw alight go on next door at dawn, he crawled out to his Chevy pickupand drove half a mile to the neighbor's.   When their niece got word at 5:30 that morning, she drovestraight to Montgomery. At the farmhouse where she'd spent childhoodvacations petting calves and eating ice cream, Sandy Lyon found twostate police troopers in a kitchen spattered with blood. In heruncles' hospital room, she says, ``I didn't recognize either one ofthem.''   Lyon, a bank teller with three grown children, has the manners ofa Sunday school teacher _ until she talks about the beating. Thenshe starts saying ``hell'' a lot.	</TEXT><NOTE>By NANCY SHULINS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Now and then when her daughters werebabies, Jean Shiner would wander the landscapes of their bodieswith her hands. ``I could feel them and know exactly who had ashort nose and who had long fingers. It was neat.''   Now Esther is 5 and Judy 3, too big to sit still for suchthings. But the memory came back recently as Jean applied calaminelotion.   The actual location of their chicken pox rash eluded her, but``I just put it all over them. That way, I figured I'd hit it.''   Which pretty much sums up the common sense, humor and love JeanShiner brings to raising two children she cannot see.   She's been blind all her life, but that never stopped her fromlearning to bicycle, ski or sail. It never stopped her from goingto college, graduating with honors or earning a master's degree.   Nor did it stop her from falling in love, with a deep-voiced,articulate man eight years her senior.   At the Perkins School for the Blind outside Boston, where Jeanboarded from age 5, ``you were encouraged to date sighted guys.''   ``We had socials. They would bring in sighted kids, but thenyou'd never see them again. The idea was you should marry someonewith a pair of eyes to drive you around and read to you and takecare of you.''   Jean married Franklin Shiner, legally blind from birth. Whichpretty much sums up her attitude about being cared for.   The Shiners' snug, red-shingled house has an ambiance any parentcan appreciate, from the crunch of a stray Cheerio in the kitchento the deflating balloons strewn about the living room, stragglersfrom Judy's birthday party. Counting the Shiner kids, the guestlist numbered nine.   Outside is the timeless small-town summer symphony of chatteringchildren, barking dogs and hissing lawn sprinklers, punctuated byslamming screen doors.   Each time the Shiners' door opens, a bell rings. ``On the firstwarm day of the year, when we all opened our doors for the firsttime, Judy kept running out,'' Jean explains.   Today, there's also the steady drone of the TV in the Shinerliving room, a rare concession to chicken pox by a mother facedwith entertaining two house-bound kids, a visitor, and a boredGerman shepherd.   She serves coffee to the visitor, cheese puffs and juice to thegirls, then pours herself a cup of tea and sinks into a kitchenchair.   Frank Shiner has already strapped on his backpack and set offfor Montpelier's lone supermarket, a two-mile round trip he makesevery other day. Jean likes to cook and has a well-stocked freezer,with a braille map.   On a normal day, Esther and Judy would be outdoors by now,riding bikes, blowing bubbles or playing with other kids. Lunch isa prelude to ``quiet time,'' followed by outings to the pool or thelibrary with Seltzer the guide dog in the lead. Jean gripsSeltzer's harness and Esther pushes Judy's stroller, a formationperfected over time.   ``Esther will help me report stores as we walk downtown, if I gopast where I wanted to go,'' says Jean, 36, a slender woman withyouthful good looks and a friendly, confident manner.   Other animals tend to be Seltzer's downfall, and ``Esther haslearned to spot them a block away. She'll yell `I see a dog! I seea cat!'   ``Probably 10 years from now I'll look back and say `How did Ido it?''' For the time being, however, Jean would much rather becalled ``ordinary'' than ``amazing,'' as in, ``Isn't she amazing?She can walk down the street with her kids and her dog!''   Esther and Judy find Jean and Frank every bit as ordinary asmost small children regard their parents. ``Mommy is blind and shecan't see and Daddy is blind and he can see a little,'' Estherexplains, in the slightly exasperated voice of big sisterseverywhere. The interview ends abruptly, as the subject losesinterest and wanders back to ``Sesame Street.''   Esther, immaculate in Oshkosh overalls, is the studious one,with thoughtful dark eyes, a neat cap of brown hair and dimpleslike her mother's. Judy's a disheveled escape artist, hazel-eyed,round-faced and rambunctious.   Both girls report each other's mischief except in cases ofconspiracy, as when, in the interest of science, they snuck alittle extra baking powder into their mother's cookie dough. ``Theywere really yucky,'' Jean says cheerfully. ``We ate them anyway.''   In the living room, the sound of crunching cheese puffs stopsabruptly, and Esther pipes up right on cue.   ``Judy's stuffing her cheeks, Mommy.''   ``Don't stuff your cheeks, Judy.''   Jean relies on a combination of intuition and hearing to tellher when her kids are up to something. Like most mothers, she'sseldom wrong.   ``They get sat in the chair when I think they're doingsomething.'' The most common chair-sitting offense at the moment:``Looking out the window at neighbors who don't go to bed when theydo.''   Esther wanders into the kitchen scrunching a brown paper bag.``Sometimes I do this to bags,'' she says solemnly, then dissolvesinto giggles as her mother swoops down and scoops her up in a hug.``Sometimes I do this to little girls,'' Jean tells her.	</TEXT><NOTE>By NANCY SHULINS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   We come to you today from the stage at TimesSquare Studios in Manhattan, where we'll be bringing you one of themost provocative pop culture phenomena of our time.   Geraldo Rivera has been called the ``P.T. Barnum of talk showhosts'' and ``the Peck's Bad Boy of television news.''   ``People'' magazine called him ``insufferable.'' The WashingtonPost denounced his last special as ``teleporn.'' Los Angeles Timescritic Howard Rosenberg says he doesn't believe a thing he seesGeraldo do.   Tell us briefly, Geraldo, in your own words: What is it about youthat so affronts so many in your profession?   ``I think envy and jealousy plays a part. There's a feeling thatI somehow gypped my way to the top. I've gone too far, gotten toobig. I've defied all their notions. I should've failed a dozen timesby now.''   He should have failed, but in the 19 years since his televisiondebut, he has earned more than 150 prizes, including three Emmys anda Peabody, and his popularity with viewers has never flagged.   ``The thing about Geraldo is that he's passionate about what hedoes,'' says Suzanne Falter-Barns, a free-lance writer in theaudience during a recent studio taping of his syndicated daily talkshow, ``Geraldo.''   ``There's no passion on TV anymore. Everything is canned,processed, fake entertainment. Geraldo's show is kind offascinatingly morbid. Because it's so dark, you get to experience alittle of your own darkness.''   Not so, says critic Tom Shales of The Washington Post. ``He's anemotional cheerleader who tries to sway audiences in a very facileand sleazy way. I call him The Great Panderer because he keepssearching for cheaper, more sordid, more sensational topics. At besthe is embarrassing.''   Despite the reviews, the Investigative News Group he formed in1986 with his wife, brother and one employee has grown to 30 people.With Tribune Entertainment, it produces his live specials and histalk show. The fastest-growing program in syndication, ``Geraldo''jumped 67 percent in the national Nielsen ratings over the pastyear, capitalizing on an age-old fascination with criminals,deviants and misfits.   Geraldo also is developing a weekly series, ``TheInvestigators,'' and has just announced plans to buy up TV stationswith five other prominent Hispanics.   Yet he remains the punch line to an industry joke: Heard aboutthe Geraldo Rivera Home Game? A life-size cardboard cutout ofGeraldo and a folding chair.   He's a target of everyone from cartoonist Garry Trudeau to JohnnyCarson, and Johnny's nights off bring no reprieve. ``Tonight Show''guest host Jay Leno finds him equally hilarious.   Geraldo's law degree has proven invaluable. Much of his careerhas been spent defending himself against charges of distorting thenews; of using drugs; of denying his heritage by calling himself``Jerry Rivers'' or, conversely, of changing his name to GeraldoRivera to cash in on ethnic hiring trends.   He pleads innocent to all counts.   ``I'm the most scrutinized person on national TV. Everything Isay, everything I do, is X-rayed nine ways to Sunday.   ``No story is worth a career. Not only is my own honor at stakebut it's the knowledge that everything I do is examined.''   He's convinced that the fuss concerns style, not substance, andthat one day, ``some biographer _ probably someone not yet born _will show me as a person who brought innovation to television.''   The Geraldo style _ explosive, confrontational, the antithesis ofthe detatched professional _ mirrors his off-camera personality.Long after the guests have gone home, Geraldo is still ``Geraldo,''a Hispanic Dudley Do-Right, a real-life Equalizer. Other men walkthe dog. Geraldo ``patrols the bowels of Central Park'' with a blackLabrador named Spike.   ``These are not postures,'' he says. He wishes he could wear asincerity meter.   ``It was always there _ the self-assuredness, the cockiness,''says Marty Berman, executive producer of ``Geraldo.'' They met atNew York's WABC-TV, which persuaded Geraldo to trade poverty law forthe ``Eyewitness News.''   Berman became his film editor in 1970. ``Nobody else wanted towork with him.'' Not only was he arrogant, Berman says, ``he wasfearless. He'd walk into a shooting gallery in the Bronx like you'dwalk into a coffee shop. He's still very difficult, very demanding.But now he's running a grown-up organization.''   C.C. Dyer, a ``Geraldo'' producer, is his fourth wife _ ``fourthand final,'' Geraldo says. The one-time notorious womanizer hasfinally removed the sign that had long been a fixture on his bedroomdoor: ``Abandon hope all ye who enter here.'' For the first timehe's wearing a ring.   Geraldo is warmer in person than he seems on TV. He laughs moreand pontificates less, and he's forever trying to get people to eat.He seems happiest when they do.   He is half Puerto Rican and half Jewish, one of five children ofLilly Friedman and Cruz Rivera, cafeteria workers who married overher parents' objections. He speaks fondly of his mother, who livesin a house he bought her in Florida, and reverentially of hisfather, who died in 1987.   ``My mom is very stereotypical, very Jewish, very oy-vey. Myfather was a very loving, sensitive, vulnerable Hispanic gentleman.''   Geraldo grew up in a blue-collar section of Long Island, ``asocial politician.'' His compulsion to prove himself is rooted inchildhood: ``When I fought, I was proving myself to the street kids.When I did well in school, I was proving myself to the smart kids.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By NANCY SHULINS</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON, (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mitch Snyder remembers cruising up the Boweryin New York as a boy, car windows tightly closed per his father'sinstructions ``to keep out the bums.''   Robert Snyder abandoned the family when his son was 9. Hurt andangry, Mitch vowed never to do to his kids what his father had doneto him. A year or so later, his teacher asked him in front of hisFlatbush classmates why his toes poked out the ends of his shoes.   At that moment, Mitch Snyder divined his future: ``I vowed to beanother Imelda Marcos. I decided then and there I would push realhard not to have holes in my shoes ever again.''   America's most influential champion of the homeless has a pastrife with cosmic irony.   Sixteen years after his father walked out, Snyder quit alucrative job as a Madison Avenue headhunter and left his own wifeand two sons to subsist on welfare and food stamps. Twenty yearslater, he has just the one pair of boots. Like the jeans he wearsand the food he eats when he's not on one of his well-publicizedhunger strikes, the tan boots are donations.   So too are the cars he occasionally drives through neighborhoodsmost people avoid. The men and women he finds there, sleeping onheating grates and harvesting meals out of trash cans, often greethim by name.   Mitch Snyder never did learn to roll up his windows.   For the past 15 years, he has dedicated himself to ``liberatingpeople who are destitute.'' To that end, no one has garnered morenewsprint, forced more hands, or coaxed more cash. But anyonetempted to pin any medals on him should take heed: Snyder is areluctant hero.   ``I was called by some force outside myself,'' says Snyder, whohas since been forgiven by his family. ``I'm convinced that if I hada choice, I wouldn't be doing this.''   It's hard to argue. All told, he has spent two of his 45 yearsfasting, and another year sleeping on sidewalks.   Now, he is embued with new optimism. After 15 years of chippingaway at the national indifference to the homeless, Snyder and othersat the forefront of the struggle may finally be gaining ground.Recent polls indicate a greater desire to help others. A newpresident has arrived. A new decade is coming.   ``I honestly believe George Bush is a nicer person,'' saysSnyder. ``I believe Ronald Reagan was nice personally, but hispolitics were mean- spirited. He was an almost impossible adversary.Not only was he made of Teflon, but he was made of magic andcharisma. Bush doesn't have that magic, and he has less power tooppose changes.''   Snyder's convinced things are changing. ``Listen to the music ofTracy Chapman, of U2. They are harbingers of a shift in mood.There's a 30-year cycle: the '30s, the '60s, the '90s. We've justcome through the `Me Decade.' I think people have gotten sick ofliving only for themselves.''   These days, Snyder makes his home in the 1,400-bed shelter onSecond Street, once a University of the District of Columbiabuilding that the Reagan administration agreed to renovate onlyafter Snyder embarked on a 51-day hunger strike that melted away 60pounds in 1984.   The shelter also is home to other members of the Community forCreative Non-Violence, a former anti-war group turned advocates forthe homeless. There is no payroll; everyone volunteers.   Commitment runs high, but this is hardly utopia. Next to sharingliving space with one's compatriots, Snyder says, starvation is easy.   But like most CCNV acts _ erecting ``Reaganville,'' a tent cityacross from the White House, or releasing a hundred cockroaches inthe state dining room _ its communal lifestyle is fraught withsymbolism.   ``Individualism is pathological,'' Snyder says. ``Ourseparateness is what's killing us. Ignorance and fear are productsof distance. That's what enables us to spend a trillion dollars ayear on arms while people sleep in the street.   ``The issue is how to reduce that distance. Once humanity is seenand felt, the ability to do damage is reduced.''   The nation's apathy toward the homeless stems largely from fear,Snyder thinks. ``They're a reflection of us. We're all vulnerable.We have to keep the messenger at bay.''   That isn't to say Americans are uncharitable, he says, but givena choice, most people are more apt to help victims of earthquakes inother countries than victims of federal housing policies in theirown.   Natural disasters, Snyder says, ``do not call into question ourvalues and our lifestyle. Homelessness does. The obvious answer,especially in cities teeming with street people, is to render thehomeless invisible.	</TEXT><NOTE>By PAIGE St. JOHN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>COPPER HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Preserving the wilderness once wasleft largely to the government. Now, private trusts are buying upland across the country in an effort to save the unplowed, theundrained and the undeveloped.   That much is obvious on the northern border of Michigan, on aspur of land that locals call the beginning of the world andtourists say is the end.   Free-lance naturalist Jim Rooks, trudging deep into the stand oftowering Estivant pines on a recent day, suddenly stops and pointswith the exuberance of a child. ``There!''   He almost topples over as he arches back to gaze up at the giantbefore him. It is a gargantuan white pine, 300 or more years old.   Then Rooks points out 19 wide tabletops of cut stumps, now turnedblack. He had come upon them in June 1987.   ``Oh, my God, my heart,'' Rooks says, recalling the warm,sickening day with its buzz of saws. ``Every tree was a drop ofblood.''   Rooks and other Michigan environmentalists claim these giant pinetrees of the Keweenaw Peninsula by Lake Superior are the largest,most extensive stand of unprotected white pine in the eastern UnitedStates.   The logging company that owns the land is ready to harvest thetrees, yet, for varied reasons, neither the U.S. Forest Service northe Michigan Department of Natural Resources has tried to save thestand. The federal government is concentrating on filling in gaps inexisting national forests while the state never has formallyconsidered saving the pines, officials with both agencies say.   Instead, the battle for the Estivant pines, named for the Frenchmerchant who bought much of the local land in 1857, has fallen intoprivate hands, paid for by anonymous donors, blue-collarphilanthropists and grade-school students.   It is, conservationists say, typical of new preservation effortsthroughout the nation.   ``If the job is going to get done, we're going to have to roll upour own sleeves and do it as private citizens,'' says Russell VanHerik, vice president for the national Nature Conservancy's Midwestregion in Minneapolis.   The Nature Conservancy is one of a growing number of private landtrusts that are buying up land and protecting endangered species asquickly as donations to cover the purchases come in.   A survey by the national Land Trust Exchange, a coordinating bodyin Alexandria, Va., turned up 743 non-profit land trusts across theUnited States last year, up from 535 just three years before. Halfof them have no staffs and less than $10,000 a year to spend.Together their memberships amount to 640,000 people.   They range from the newly formed Kachemak Bay Heritage Land Trustin wilderness-rich Homer, Alaska, to the 98-year-old Trustees ofReservations in crowded Massachusetts.   ``It's an amazingly rapidly growing movement,'' says Jean Hocker,executive director of the exchange.   ``What's happened is a sense of real dismay of what's happeningin communities. A feeling that the people who live there have totake care of it,'' Hocker says. ``As development pressures increaseon the land, people are realizing that protection of open land isthe responsibility of all of us.''   While private trusts also guard land for scenic views andplaygrounds, the strongest interest is in preserving ecologicallyimportant areas, Hocker says. Some trusts manage the sanctuaries ontheir own, while others turn them over to government agencies forpublic parks and forests.   Van Herik says the Nature Conservancy considers itself ``theNoah's ark of this country.'' The national trust, which centers itsefforts on endangered species and ecologies, has set aside 3.5million acres of land, including 396 preserves in 12 Midwesternstates.	</TEXT><NOTE>By PAIGE St. JOHN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>DRUMMOND ISLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The way things have been goingsince the arrival of Tom Monaghan, it was no surprise what happenedto his turkeys.   When Monaghan set up his spread two years ago in a decayingretreat on this blue-collar fishing island on Lake Huron, he letthe tame farm birds run loose.   It was just going to be a vacation home, Monaghan said. But intwo years, he apparently changed his mind and what he has done tothe island instead has so angered many of the islanders that onenight somebody wrung those turkeys' necks.   Monaghan, king of Domino's Pizza, Inc., and entrepreneurextraordinaire, has converted his Domino's Lodge into a corporateretreat, built Frank Lloyd Wright copy homes for himself and histop executives, cleared the woods to make room for an 18-hole golfcourse, added a pond and a sewer plant and started building cabins.   He and his associated landholding companies have bought morethan 1,700 acres of Drummond Island, excluding two auxiliaryislands and other parcels snapped up around the island by landspeculators doing business with Monaghan.   Monaghan talked of plans for more _ condominiums, marinas,lodges, banks and golf courses. While he pledged his support forconservation by stopping his bulldozers from knocking down a treewith nesting woodpeckers, his workers filled in wetlands.   Island tempers boiled over. The neck-wringing was one moreunpleasant reminder that some Drummond Islanders would just as soonsee Tom Monaghan pack up his world-class resort plans and take hisjobs elsewhere.   That doesn't faze Monaghan, an orphan from northern Michigan whobuilt a pizza empire on a 30-minute delivery guarantee and alsoowns the Detroit Tigers baseball team.   The harbor dredging is on hold and Domino's island bank has beencanned, but Monaghan has kept right on building and buying. Tamerabbits now wander among the shady cedar groves at Domino's Lodge.   Unannounced, Monaghan popped in on the back-to-back DrummondIsland Township board and Chamber of Commerce meeting this springand told islanders what's what.   ``For good or bad, things can't go back the way they were,''Monaghan said. ``Even if we tore Domino's Lodge to the ground andleft, Drummond Island would never be the same...It will prosperwith or without us.''   Monaghan went on:   Island residents can jump on board the boom and build their ownmotels and restaurants and lodges. Or they can sit by and watchoutsiders do the same, he said.   ``It's up to the little business to think a little bigger, notjust sit back and complain about everybody else,'' Monaghan said.   He is right, Drummond Island never will be the same, saidtownship supervisor, tax assessor and schoolteacher Frank Sasso.   The change is a shock for the modest island folk who measuretheir day around the mainland ferry schedule and whose idea ofprogress was marked recently with the erection of Drummond Island'sfirst four-way stop sign.   ``Tom doesn't mean harm,'' Sasso said. ``He just sees potentialand we see a place to live.''   Before Tom Monaghan, Drummond Island was known mostly as a placefor perch, bear and bobcat. The state owns 52 percent of the9-mile-long island. Its winter population hovers around 700, manyof them summer vacationers who stayed on in retirement.   Island economy was built on the back of a limestone gravel pit,but its owners laid off and sold out. Today, Drummond lives mostlyoff the spending of the sport fishing trade. Cabin rentals are thegoing thing.   Sasso said he expects the island to be invaded by a new class ofpeople, the walk-and-shop tourist.   ``For islanders, it's not what they came here to live for. A lotof people here work for a lot less money than they can getelsewhere just so they can live here,'' said Sasso, stabbing thetable with his finger.   Nobody on Drummond Island is sure how far Monaghan wants tobuild or how much more land he wants to acquire. The pizza kingtalks loosely of plans to expand the lodge to 40 rooms, buildanother lodge and add 40 units around the golf course.	</TEXT><NOTE>By PAIGE St. JOHN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign trade couldn't be muchfreer than in the Twin Saults, the two cities with the same nameseparated by the 2{-mile breadth of the St. Marys River and flyingdifferent flags.   Americans and Canadians go back and forth across the border indroves to buy bread, have babies or drink beer, without a worryabout tariffs or quotas.   ``We call it jumping across the big ditch,'' says Canadian steelworker Richard Shurtliffe.   On Wednesdays after work, Shurtliffe and his buddies hop the St.Marys from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to the $1-a-beer bars inSault Ste. Marie, Mich. Canadian brew tastes better, but Americansuds are cheaper, Shurtliffe says.   Beer isn't the only bargain.   Canada's dairy prices, for instance, are jacked up by a farmsupport system that is unlikely to change even under the country'sfree-trade agreements with the United States. No matter, Shurtliffesays. He buys American.   Not only does he buy U.S. milk for his grandchildren, he fillshis pickup truck with U.S. gasoline and his refrigerator with U.S.steaks.   Even Canadian cigarettes are cheaper in U.S. stores.   ``It's an awful savings,'' Shurtliffe says. ``It seemseverything's cheaper in Michigan.''   It's a commerce without national loyalty. In the Sault(pronounce it soo), many American women have their American babiesin Canada and tourists buy their Canadian souvenirs in the UnitedStates.   The biggest traffic jams at Canada customs are at 2:30 a.m.,when the U.S. bars close and Canadians go home.   Customs agent Giacomo Pastore has seen the happy drivers line upfor as long as 45-minute waits at the border crossing into Canada.   ``It's a ritual,'' Pastore says.   ``It's an awful pile of Canadians,'' Shurtliffe says.   Locals call them the Twin Saults or the Two Saults, but thesecities on opposite sides of the Soo shipping locks are anything butidentical.   Historical markers on the U.S. side tell of the treaty takingnorthern Michigan from the Chippewa Indians. A plaque on Canadiansoil remembers the shameful ``Chicoro Incident'' of 1870, when theUnited States refused a Canadian military ship passage through theU.S. locks. The Canadians had to walk around the St. Marys rapids.   Sault, Ont., is six times the size of Sault, Mich. The Ontariotown of 83,000 has a steel mill, paper mill and a large shoppingmall. Its downtown Queen Street is dotted with upscale china shops.   Sault, Ont., also has more movie theaters, a lower drinking ageand two strip clubs, says Michigan teen-ager Dean Newcomb.   Michigan's Sault is a quiet home to 14,500 people, many of whomdon't lock their doors. Summer tourism is the major industry.Winter snow is the biggest occurence. From a three-block drive ofkitsch shops, visitors can buy blue wind chimes from Taiwan andT-shirts that say Canada.   Canada?   ``It's hard to buy a Canadian souvenir in their Sault,''explains Bob Smith, owner of a block of such tourist emporiums asShips Ahoy, Captains Quarters and the Anchor and Seven Seas motels.``This is where the tourists shop.''   Since the signing of the free-trade pact between the twocountries, the easy commerce between the Saults has become evenfreer and easier.   ``It seems to have opened up the gate,'' says Patrick Shannon,the Chippewa County prosecutor on the Michigan side. ``Trade hasn'tchanged, but all of a sudden the Canadians have realized they cango shopping on our side. Crossing the border isn't such an issueanymore.''   That's a problem. Law enforcement in Sault, Mich., used to be apersonal matter. You knew who was having a family fight and who wasdriving home from the bar.   With so many people crossing over these days, the town is fullof strangers. ``We don't know who we're dealing with anymore,''Shannon says.   Not all of the foreign trade is faring well.   American insurance companies have put a crimp in theonce-booming business of delivering babies in Ontario. Ten yearsago, as many as 20 percent of the women patients of an Ontarioobstetrician, Dr. T. Orr, were Americans drawn by themore-specialized services available in Ontario.   Now, with U.S. Medicare and many insurance companies refusing topay for health care outside the United States, foreigners make uponly 8 percent of Orr's practice.   Because the banks and bars, tourist centers and tollgates allset their own exchange rates, commerce between the Saults can getcomplicated. Those who cross frequently must master ``border math.''   Shurtliffe's wife, Ruth, for example, can figure which ischeaper: gasoline at 54 cents Canadian per liter or $1.21 Americanper gallon. That is considering also that her Canadian dollarcurrently buys only 80 cents American and she has to pay $1.50 todrive across the International Bridge.   It can get so confusing many businesses accept the othercountry's currency, even if it isn't legal tender. A Canadiandollar will buy as much beer at David Dear's Back Door bar as aU.S. greenback.   ``After all, we are the Twin Saults,'' Dear says. More than halfof his customers are Canadians.   With the American dollar worth more at the moment, U.S.residents forgetting to exchange their money for Canadian suffer adouble whammy. Not only do most Canadian businesses take U.S.currency at the lower Canadian value, but Canadian prices often arehigher.   ``There is an advantage of having the right money on the rightside at the right time,'' says Linda Sumner, a Michigan touristfrom Livonia.   Grant Putman, a farmer from Williamston, Mich., got caught in aCanadian restaurant with hungry kids and only U.S. cash in hiswallet. He paid American and bought his food for 15 percent morethan true cost.   ``Of course, the waitress gave me my change in Canadian, so Iwas out there, too,'' Putman said.   ``I got even. I tipped her in Canadian.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By PAUL DE LA GARZA</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SOUTH ROXANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lonely yellow stick character, armsoutstretched, looks down at 8-year-old Jason Robertson from a posterin his kitchen.   ``I have AIDS,'' the poster says. ``Please hug me. I can't makeyou sick.''   As if it were Jason speaking.   Jason suffers from AIDS-related complex, or ARC, a disease thatoften precedes the fatal full-blown acquired immune deficiencysyndrome. At school, he was isolated in a trailer next door to theclassroom, and his only real friend was a tattered doll named Mick.   Jason's story is similar to the plight of Indiana's Ryan White,an AIDS victim shunned at school and forced to leave town.   Jason is the only student in the school trailer.   He has endured a lawsuit and a move from nearby Granite City tothis tiny, Southern Illinois community in search of peace. Phonecalls playing funeral music and taunts added to the scorn.   Now his mother, Tammie, father, Al, and 10-year-old sister,Melissa, are picking up the pieces after a struggle that turnedneighbor against neighbor in a battle over Jason's future.   Jason weighs only 46 pounds and stands about 4 feet tall. Hismost striking features are his big brown eyes. A quiet boy, heanswers most questions with few words.   ``I like good people,'' Jason says. ``I like to go places.''   When he grows up, he says, he wants to be a police officer.   Jason was born with hemophilia, a condition in which the bloodfails to clot properly. He also had stomach problems and a shortenedesophagus _ problems that were corrected by surgery.   But he underwent hundreds of blood transfusions, and at least oneof them involved tainted blood products that brought the deadly AIDSvirus into his body. In March 1986, Jason was diagnosed with ARC.   That was the beginning. Now the family, its former schooldistrict and neighbors wish they had done some things differently.   Fearing he would endanger other children, his mother pulled himfrom kindergarten in Granite City and a district tutor taught him athome until November 1987.   That's when the Robertsons and the school district agreed thatJason should be taught in a special trailer 50 feet from regularclasses.   Jason started school 15 minutes before the other students everyday and left 15 minutes later than they did. He was not allowed onthe playground.   School officials say they told Mrs. Robertson that Jason probablywould be placed in regular classes at the school of 750 in the fallof 1988 because his health had improved.   But Mrs. Robertson contends the district made the offer onlyafter the American Civil Liberties Union, at her request, filed alawsuit on Jason's behalf in April.   On May 5, a federal judge ordered Jason back into regularclasses. But the ruling touched off protests from parents in GraniteCity, a steel town of 36,800 across the Mississippi River from St.Louis.   Angry parents chanted, ``Back to the trailer!'' upon his arrival.   Drew Callender, 29, says he got into the fight because of angerand fear for his children's safety. ``I did say some foolishthings.'' He also founded an informal group of protesting parentscalled ``SAVE,'' the Society Against Virus Environment.   ``It's a fear of not knowing,'' he says.   Mrs. Robertson says she got up to three telephone calls a dayfrom protesters, threatening her and Jason. People hurled epithetson the street. ``Home had become a war zone, and I felt like I wasdying inside,'' she says.	</TEXT><NOTE>By PAUL NOWELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Perhaps it's fitting that the world'slargest repository of weather records is housed in a 1920s-vintageindoor shopping mall that leaks during downpours.   Accurate weather records dating back to 1890 _ some even to thetime of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock _ are available at theNational Climatic Data Center, which has dozens of cubbyholeoffices in the the historic building guarded by two terra-cottagriffins.   ``Every time it rains hard the roof leaks and we have to breakout the buckets,'' says Steve Doty, the center's project director.   Despite the accomodations, the center, with a staff of 300,turns out an impressive amount of weather information, answering85,000 queries last year alone.   ``We can't give you the weather forecast for next week but wecan give you a look back 100 years,'' Doty says. ``Our role is tosupply the historical perspective.''   The center's long view at the world's climate can be vital whenit comes to such things as fighting world hunger, sendingastronauts into space or winning court cases.   For example, when an Exxon tanker spilled 10 million barrels ofoil in March into Prince William Sound in Alaska, industry andgovernment experts called the center to learn what kind of weatherconditions could be expected during the cleanup.   By coincidence, the center had just published a climatic atlasof the area, which provided detailed information on temperatures,wind speed and ocean currents.   Bill Brower, who helped prepare the atlas, said the data showedthe 70-mph winds that hit the Valdez area at the time of theaccident were unusual for that time of year. The information wasbeneficial as cleanup efforts were coordinated.   ``What we offer is a lot of good hard science,'' Doty says. ``Wecan tell you normals and extremes so you know what to expect.''   While keeping weather records may seem like dull work, some ofthe greatest minds in U.S. history have shown an interest in it.   Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington Carver allwere amateur weather observers. Copies of their records can befound at the center, which is part of the U.S. CommerceDepartment's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   The tons of records stored in the center's basement aretestimony to generations of less-famous volunteer weather trackers.   ``We've even got a copy of a diary with weather records fromPlymouth Rock,'' Doty says.   Most of the bound records stored in what once was the mall'sunderground parking deck come from places like Vicksburg, Miss.,St. Joseph, Mo., or Bear Mountain, N.Y., since 1890.   So if you've just got to know how many times it snowed inChicago on April 30 for the past 99 years, the folks at the NCDCcan help.   The raw data comes from the military, the National WeatherService, the Federal Aviation Administration and 8,000 volunteerweather observers. Hourly weather observations pour in from aroundthe globe, much of them from 10,000 ships stationed in variouspositions and from weather satellites orbiting Earth.   Current records are stored on computer. But because of budgetconstraints the center has been able to save on microfiche only afourth of the 200 million paper records.   In 1951, the center was moved from New Orleans to Asheville inthe mountains of western North Carolina. The city had a pool ofworkers skilled in key-punch machines, so the government bought theArcade Building and set up shop.   At one time, the sprawling building that takes up an entire cityblock was bulging at the seams with key-punch cards. Now its roomsare stuffed with computers and microfiche readers.   The center prints about 5,000 different publications on suchtopics as hourly precipitation data by state, national storm dataand global climatic data. The publications go out to more than50,000 individuals and businesses.   Seven staff meteorologists answer thousands of telephone andmail queries each month. Over the years, they have been asked somepeculiar questions, including:   _A free-lance writer wanted to know what the weather was likeduring the Oct. 30, 1938 radio broadcast of the ``The War of theWorlds.''   _Actress Carol Burnett called to find out whether thunderstormsand hail hit the San Antonio area on April 26, 1933, the day shewas born.   _A company planning to shoot a television commercial wanted toknow where in the United States they were likely to find snow onthe ground in November. They were instructed to shoot on locationin Stampede Pass, Wash., which averages 64 inches of snow eachNovember.   _A Texas law firm requested wind speed and direction records fora client who was planning to build a chicken coop. The lawyerswanted to show that the odors from the coop would not be blown tosurrounding homes.   _A chocolate candy company planning a summer publicity campaignrequested nighttime temperatures in several Midwestern towns tohelp them pinpoint the best time to leave samples on doorsteps.   One out of three requests come from attorneys trying toreconstruct weather conditions in accident or criminal cases, saysSam McCown, the center's supervisory meteorologist.   The minimum charge for information was increased recently to$12, while the average cost is about $40. Some complicated requestscan cost several thousand dollars.   Last summer, the center set up a special office to handlerequests for drought-related information. Calls came in from allover the country.   Richard Heim, who was in charge of the drought office, saidrecords on file from the 1930s and the 1950s put last year's dryweather into perspective.   At the peak of the 1988 drought, about 26 percent of the countrywas classified as experiencing extreme drought. On his computer,Heim called up a map from 1934 which showed 45 percent of thecountry was suffering from extreme drought.   The weather records also help scientists explore such things asthe ``greenhouse effect,'' a warming of Earth's temperatures thathas been attributed to industrial growth.   ``There are some scientists who believe the 1988 drought wascaused by the greenhouse effect,'' Heim says. ``We've had worsedroughts. If this one was caused by that, what caused the droughtsof the 1930s and 1950s?''	</TEXT><NOTE>By PETER ENG</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SITE B, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>  Khmer Rouge communist guerrillas areholding tens of thousands of Cambodian refugees virtual prisoners incamps in Thailand to serve a war machine bent on reseizing Cambodia,international aid officials say.   Some refugees have escaped to tell the story, people like MomSokhon, a teen-age girl.   Mom Sokhon survived four years under a Khmer Rouge regime thatslaughtered six of her relatives and hundreds of thousands of otherpeople in Cambodia. After invading Vietnamese forces ousted theregime, she headed to refugee camps in Thailand seeking haven fromthe war.   But Mom Sokhon wound up in the Khmer Rouge-controlled camp ofHuay Chan, and there, she said, the horror began again.   The guerrillas forced the 15-year-old girl to toil all day makingpunji, bamboo spears for impaling enemy soldiers. Hauling punishingloads of punji, rice and B-67 anti-tank rounds, she had to makeregular treks through heavily mined mountain passes from the camp toguerrilla bases inside Cambodia.   Often on the journey, at times a month long, two or three womenhad their legs blown off by mines or were shot dead in firefightswith the Vietnamese, she says.   ``If anyone refused to join the transport team, she would bepunished with no food and sent to an underground prison,'' she says.   After five years at Huay Chan, Mom Sokhon fled in November tothis refugee camp in eastern Surin province controlled by thenon-communist guerrillas of Prince Nodorom Sihanouk. She fears theKhmer Rouge will hunt her down.   Other Cambodian guerrilla groups and Thai security personnel alsohave frequently abused refugees in the camps along the Cambodianfrontier, but the Khmer Rouge is different.   A senior official experienced with rebel movements in Africa andthe Middle East says that even in the ruthless world of guerrillawarfare ``it's an unusual feature'' to use children as militaryporters.   ``The disregard for the sick and the disabled is extreme,'' hesays. ``There's a kind of totalitarianism I don't see elsewhere.''   Aid officials say hundreds, perhaps thousands, of refugees havedied of malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases because the KhmerRouge refused to treat them properly or would not allow them to seeforeign doctors because they would be ``polluted'' by them.   Another official, also speaking anonymously, said the peoplebeing held in the Khmer Rouge camps ``hardly smile at you, nevergreet you. They are afraid. In the other camps, the children run upand talk to you. This never happens in a Khmer Rouge camp. I thinkthey are systematically educating the parents to tell the childrennot to talk to foreigners.''   Concern over Khmer Rouge abuses has sharpened with theguerrillas' recent relocation of thousands of refugees out of twoUnited Nations-assisted camps.   Some 7,000 refugees were moved from Ta Luan camp to a border areawhere they came under heavy shelling in November. Many refugees werebelieved hurt but the guerrillas have refused to allow aid officialsaccess to them.   The Khmer Rouge has denied all charges of abuse. Or Hy, anadministrator at its showcase camp of Site B, said the people weremoving and portering voluntarily and added that ``all Khmer(Cambodians) should fight back the Vietnamese.''   When the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in 1975-78, they attempted tocreate a new agrarian society with purges, torture, and massrelocations of people from the cities to rural slave labor camps. Itdestroyed religion, culture and history to bring Cambodia back to``year zero'' and held the people under the fearful grip of``angka'' _ the organization.   Vietnam's invasion in late 1978 drove the Chinese-armed KhmerRouge to the Thai-Cambodian border, where it set up base camps. Tensof thousands of civilians under Khmer Rouge control were driven intoThailand by the devastating Vietnamese offensive of 1985.   In the few camps where aid workers have access, the Khmer Rougeseems to have abandoned the mass killings. But it maintains itsmilitaristic and xenphobic control over virtually every aspect ofpeople's lives. Marriage must be approved by camp authorities.Religious practice is banned. Most men wear Chinese militaryuniforms. In some camps, people cannot walk outside their ownsection.	</TEXT><NOTE>By PETER MATTIACE</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A century later, Elsie Frum remembersvividly the steady, shrill whistle of warning and the horrifyingwall of water that killed 2,209 people in the Johnstown Flood of1889.   ``My father ran into the house and said, `Run! The dam hasbroken!' And we ran. We just got out in time,'' Mrs. Frum recalls.   ``It was terrible. It sounded like thunder. It took everything,everything in front of it _ railroad engines, the roundhouse. Ittook all the buildings. It looked like an ocean.   ``Then there was nothing left. It was like a beach when it wasover. We just stood there and watched it. Everyone was stunned. Wedidn't know what to do.''   Mrs. Frum, 106 years old and a great-great-grandmother, is thelast known survivor who remembers the flood of May 31, 1889, thefirst of three floods to devastate this western Pennsylvaniamountain city and nearby villages.   One of the five worst natural disasters in U.S. history, theJohnstown Flood of 1889 was caused by the collapse of the SouthFork Dam about 15 miles northeast and 450 feet above Johnstown.   The 72-foot-high earthen dam held a private lake for theexclusive summertime recreation of such 19th century industrialbarons as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon.Experts said later it was weakened by poor maintenance andextraordinarily heavy rains of up to 10 inches in 24 hours.   The dam's collapse sent a 35- to 80-foot surge of water racingdown the narrow Little Conemaugh River Valley, sweeping awayhouses, barns, railroad cars and locomotives, telegraph poles,livestock, people and nearly everything else before it hitJohnstown at 4:07 p.m., 57 minutes after the dam broke.   Then a budding industrial city of about 10,000 deep in abowl-like valley, Johnstown was already under several feet of waterfrom the rains.   The mid-afternoon flood waters, pushing a roll of debris beforeit, crashed into the city's busy steel mills, fragile wood-framehomes and finally into its sturdy Pennsylvania Railroad bridge.   ``Most of the people in Johnstown never saw the water coming;they only heard it,'' historian David G. McCullough wrote in his1968 book, ``The Johnstown Flood.''   ``Those who actually saw the wall of water would talk and writeabout how it `snapped off trees like pipestems' or `crushed houseslike eggshells,''' McCullough wrote. ``But what seemed to make themost lasting impression was the cloud of dark spray that hung overthe front of the wave...It was talked of as `the death mist' andwould be remembered always.''   Scores of stranded people floated on a huge jumble of wreckagecovering about 30 acres that jammed up at the stone railroad bridgejust below downtown. But the great pile caught fire and 80 helplessvictims died in a second horror.   Clara Barton, then 67 years old and eager to promote her newAmerican Red Cross, rushed in from Washington, D.C., and set upheadquarters inside a boxcar.   The new Red Cross helped organize field hospitals, kitchens andlaundries. Five months later, Johnstown's citizens bid her farewellwith a diamond locket and their grateful thanks.   Mrs. Frum, then a 6-year-old schoolgirl, lived with her parentsand two younger sisters in East Conemaugh, just upriver fromJohnstown. Her father, John Shaffer, owned a planing mill next door.   Mrs. Frum remembered her father was a nosy and nervous man,especially about increasing rumors that the South Fork Dam was introuble.   Shaffer had stepped outside in the rain to see if nearby woodenbridges were still standing when, Mrs. Frum recalls, everyone heardengineer John Hess' heroic warning whistle from the cab ofPennsylvania Railroad Engine 1124.   McCullough wrote, ``Hess in his engine blazed down the valley,the water practically on top of him, in an incredibly heroic dashto sound the alarm...Nearly everyone in East Conemaugh heard it andunderstood almost instantly what it meant.''   ``That was our Paul Revere,'' Mrs. Frum recalls. ``A man hadtaken his train up and he was on the way down, and saw the dam hadbroken. And he tied his whistle down. He jumped. He was saved. Hestayed on it till he got into Conemaugh.   ``My father knew then that the dam had broken,'' she says.	</TEXT><NOTE>By PETER SANDS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Melvil Dewey envisioned how a libraryshould be organized more than a century ago, he couldn't haveguessed how his system would be tested in the future.   He could hardly have foreseen in 1873, for example, theinvention of computers, or the spread of AIDS and advancements inmedical science such diseases engender.   Or the high-speed, low-cost printing presses that turn out sovery many books each year. Since 1979, over a million volumes havebeen assigned Dewey Decimal numbers.   And with the publication this year of the 20th edition ofDewey's revolutionary system _ the first complete update in adecade _ just about the only constants of the Dewey DecimalClassification are its basic structure and its publisher, Albany'sForest Press.   But that, after all, was Dewey's vision. The strength andpopularity of the system lie in its adaptability.   From a slant toward subjects a white, middle-class American malein the 19th century might study _ European literature, the Bibleand classical philosophy, Romance and Germanic languages, thenatural sciences and history _ the system has assimilated otherliteratures and cultures to become the most popular method oforganizing libraries in the world.   ``Dewey had definitely a white, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon bias.Over the years, as other editors have worked on the Dewey, therehas been a constant effort to correct for this,'' says ArnoldWajenberg, principal cataloger and professor of libraryadministration at the University of Illinois in Urbana.   Wajenberg, who is also on the advisory committee which overseesthe Dewey's updates, adds, ``There is a very definite United Statesbias, Western European bias which is especially damaging as itbecomes a worldwide classification.''   Familiar to most grade school children, the Dewey Decimal systemis used to organize libraries so books can be found easily. Andreports written, languages learned, curiosity quenched.   A book is assigned a number to the left of the decimal, placingit in a general category. To the right of the decimal, it isassigned numbers that describe the particular book. By adding orsubtracting numbers, a person can find other books on more specificor general topics. New books can be squeezed into the library'scatalog in the same way.   The system is sophisticated enough to catalog millions ofvolumes and simple enough for a child to quickly learn. So simpleand sophisticated, in fact, that its editor, John Comaromi, says itwill ``stand for all time.''   ``The thing is, it's powerful, it's really powerful,'' he says.``It really fits human expression of ideas.''   Comaromi is head of the Decimal Classification Division at theLibrary of Congress in Washington, D.C., where the Dewey numbersare actually assigned.   Translated into 34 languages, from German to Gujarati, the Deweysystem is now used in 95 percent of the world's libraries.   It stands in near-constant transition, with differences in thetwo most recent editions illustrating its changing face.   For example, work began on the 19th edition in 1972. When it waspublished, in 1979, crack cocaine was unknown and there was littlepublished about drugs in general. But as the next decade passed,information piled up and social attitudes changed, prompting majorchanges in the 20th edition. AIDS had the same effect, with itsimpact on epidemiology, biochemistry, even sociology, Comaromi says.   The rapid rise of computer technology even prompted a separate,between-editions edition, and will prompt future changes in thesystem itself, as it is adapted for publication in computer form.   ``We have this tension between stability in libraries and thenadvancement and progress for people using the classification as thewindow into knowledge, to the whole world of knowledge,'' Comaromisays. ``If it's going to be a window into knowledge, it's got to becurrent.''   That's the sole purpose of Forest Press _ keeping the Dewey inline with what's being published, says executive director PeterPaulson.   Paulson, like Melvil Dewey, is a former director of the New YorkState Library, one of the first libraries to adopt the system.   Dewey developed his system in 1873 while a student at AmherstCollege in Massachusetts and worked on it the rest of his life.   In 1911, after resigning his post and moving to Lake Placid,N.Y., he founded Forest Press, housing it at the Lake Placid Club.In the early 1970s, the press moved to Albany, and earlier thisyear it was purchased by private information-systems giant OCLC ofDublin, Ohio.   Although there was at the time neither regular training forlibrarians nor a widely used classification system, Dewey based hissystem on others, such as the scheme created by former U.S.Secretary of Education William Torrey Harris for the St. LouisPublic Library earlier in the 19th century.   While about 200,000 libraries in more than 130 countries now usethe Dewey, other systems compete for attention. Many major researchlibraries use the Library of Congress' scheme, the Soviet Union hasits own system, and the Universal Decimal Classification _ derivedin the 20th century from the Dewey _ is popular in Europe,Wajenberg says. But the Dewey is king for now.   Its real effectiveness can be seen every time an adult entersthe public library and finds it familiar, years after firstencountering the system. For, as Paulson sums up: ``This is asystem for organizing all the world's knowledge.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</NOTE><NOTE>AP Business Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y.

He wears a disposable lens in hisright eye.   ``I don't think we've ever seen anything, in my experience, thatgained this kind of acceptance,'' says Hal Johnson, president ofprofessional products at Bausch &amp; Lomb, the nation's leading sellerof contact lenses. ``We're in high gear. And I mean high gear.''   It hasn't been too long ago that basketball games were stoppedwhile players scoured the floor for a missing contact lens. Mostpeople still coddle and clean their lenses, treating them like tinytreasures.   They even buy insurance policies to protect them from loss ordamage.   Now, along come some lenses that can be worn for a week or twoand tossed in the trash. If they hurt your eye, just take them outand put in a new pair. No more expensive cleaning solutions. Nomore tender-loving care.   Is ``wear 'em and toss 'em'' the wave of the future?   Probably not, say officials at Bausch &amp; Lomb and other eye careexperts.   The main reason is that most of the most of the lenses availablecan only be worn by patients who are nearsighted. Another negativefactor is the cost _ between $300 and $500 per year.   Disposable contacts were introduced in the United States in July1987 by Vistakon Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which upuntil March was the only maker of a disposable lens with nationaldistribution. Vistakon's throwaway lenses are called Accuvue.   Bausch &amp; Lomb started selling disposable contacts nationally inMarch and CIBA Vision, the second-leading maker, has startedselling disposable contacts in California that can be worn by bothnearsighted and farsighted people.   CIBA's Kim Little says lenses, called NewVues, should beavailable nationally later this year.   Johnson says Bausch &amp; Lomb expects that between 10 percent and20 percent of all contact lens wearers in the country will switchto disposable lenses.   But even that small percentage will have astounding businessimplications for the contact lens industry.   Consider that a patient who normally would have walked into anoptometrist's office and left with a new pair of lenses could nowwalk away with u to 52 pairs of lenses.   The average disposable customer, using either a one-week or atwo-week replacement schedule, will use 39 pairs of lenses a year.   That means that instead of selling four million lenses a year tothe roughly 2 million disposable customers, eye doctors will sell156 million lenses a year.   Bausch &amp; Lomb is expanding its three largest contact lensmanufacturing plants, including the renovation of an area inRochester, roughly the size of two football fields, that will bedevoted to the company's SeeQuence line of disposable lenses.   This flurry of activity is all possible because Bausch &amp; Lomband Vistakon have been able to dramatically lower the cost ofmaking a contact lens.   Irving Aarons, a stock analyst for Arthur D. Little inCambridge, Mass., estimates that Bausch &amp; Lomb can make adisposable lens for less than $1, maybe as low as 75 cents. Itsells two lenses for $5 to practitioners, who turn around and sellthem for $7 to $10.	</TEXT><NOTE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y.

Patterned after its Italian namesake and featuring a fewsurviving canals, the one-time center of Prohibition-era speak-easynight life was adopted by Beat Generation poets before hippies madeit their Southern California crash pad.   It is the home to fabled Muscle Beach and remains acounterculture haven for 1960s-style peace protesters, New Agehealers, artists, roller skaters, surfers and scores of streetperformers. Acts range from a chain-saw tossing juggler to a limbodancer prancing on a bed of broken glass.   ``This is America we come to see,'' says Ingrid Nilsson, 22, ofSweden. ``We can wear bikinis and go shopping.''   Competing for tourist dollars along bustling Ocean Front Walk arepeddlers offering rock crystals touted for their alleged healingpowers, tie-dyed clothing and handmade jewelry sold on card tables.Storefront merchants sell souvenir T-shirts, sunglasses and hats.   Sprinkled among the vendors are aging hippie fortunetellers,peace activists selling bumper stickers and buttons, caricatureartists and masseuses, including one who offers a standing massagewithin a wood-pole pyramid topped with aluminum foil.   Vivid, sometimes startling wall murals appear anonymouslyovernight, only to be plastered with colorful gang graffiti withindays.   Out-of-town visitors mingle at sidewalk cafes withespresso-sipping Bohemians sporting ponytails and wearing tatteredjeans. Strollers meander through clouds of incense, chantingBuddhists, naked toddlers and pungent smoke wafting from marijuanajoints puffed in the open.   Cops walking their beats in short pants occasionally draw nearundetected and move in to make a collar.   Hungry visitors choose between take-out meals ranging fromvegetarian fast-food to New York-style pizza as they watch daredevilroller skaters jump hurdles or an elderly thrill-seeker known asSkateboard Mama weave through a slalom course marked by empty cups.   Venice's eclectic allure has drawn such celebrity residents asCharlie Chaplin, the late rock 'n' roll star Jim Morrison,science-fiction author Ray Bradbury, actor-director Dennis Hopperand actress Lisa Bonet of ``The Cosby Show.''   Sometimes called Los Angeles' ``Slum by the Sea,'' Venice issandwiched between upscale, rent-controlled Santa Monica to thenorth and the yachting yuppie enclave of Marina del Rey to the south.   Venice's liberal reputation draws hundreds of homeless people andteen-age runaways to its alleyways, in addition to muscle-boundbodybuilders, skinhead punk rockers, nude sunbathers and hordes oftourists.   It also has its share of run-down neighborhoods populated byviolent street gangs, drug dealers, prostitutes and``strawberries,'' the slang name given to streetwalkers who sellthemselves in exchange for drugs.   ``People who don't fit in anywhere else find a home here, even ifit's only for a week or a night _ or an hour,'' says Oscar, abedraggled blues singer who declined to give his last name.   ``Got me a little angel. I love the way she spreads her wings,''Oscar croons, a grimy cap set on the ground to receive donationsfrom appreciative passersby.   Another Venice street minstrel, who has become something of arolling landmark, is Harry Parry, a costumed guitar player whoskates among the tourists every day, pausing to serenade anyonewilling to listen.   ``This beach is an oasis of light in a pool of darkness _ wherewe can all be who we are,'' says Parry, who covers his massivedreadlock hairdo in a makeshift turban and wears baseball shinguards over his flowing robes as part of his distinctive outfit.   His skates are remnants of the 1970s, when Venice became theSouthern California center for disco roller-skating. Skaters stillflock to Venice, including one known as Tex who rolls on18-inch-tall stilt skates mounted to his cowboy boots.   Venice was created soon after the turn of the century on 160acres about 15 miles west of downtown Los Angeles by tobaccomillionaire Abbot Kinney, who envisioned a stately cultural centerserviced by an array of canals.   He imported singing gondoliers from Italy to operate a flotillaof authentic Venetian gondolas and officially opened the newcommunity on July 4, 1905. Attractions included a carnival pier anda miniature railroad.   Kinney's highbrow dreams of a fine arts center fizzled. Developedinstead were bawdy vaudeville acts, gin joints, gambling dens andfreak shows.   Its main daytime attraction was a covered bathhouse that featuredheated sea water and 600 private dressing rooms for modest bathers.   Actress Sarah Bernhardt performed at the 3,400-seat VeniceAuditorium in 1906 and reportedly made 20 curtain calls during threesold-out shows, but few other celebrities of note came to Veniceother than to gamble or sample the racy night life.   Perhaps the first person to ride the surf at Venice was Olympicswimmer Duke Kahanamoku, a Hawaiian native considered to be thefather of modern wave riding. Historians report he rode a redwoodsurfboard near the popular pier in the first decade of the 20thcentury.   Most of the original canals were filled in during the 1930s andnot long afterward Venice became an oil boom town dotted withderricks which were dismantled later when the crude dried up.   Venice is to beach towns what Berkeley is to college towns, andfueling its diverse, avant-garde image are chic art galleries,trendy coffeehouses and pricey restaurants.   Further contrasts are provided by fortress-like remodeled homessurrounded by fences topped with razor-sharp barbed wire that standalongside dilapidated seaside cottages, some occupied by severalfamilies.   Prominent in the gentrification of Venice is 72 Market Street, adinner house opened by Tony Bill, producer of such films as``Shampoo'' and ``The Sting,'' with the help of investors such asactor Dudley Moore, who occasionally drops in to play the piano.   Topping a long list of serious art sellers in Venice is the L.A.Louver Gallery, which introduced internationally renowned painterDavid Hockney to Southern California.   A popular gathering spot to see and be seen over espresso andcroissants is the Rose Cafe, where aspiring actors read scriptsbefore auditions, writers scribble in notebooks and occasionally aworking actor like Gary Busey stops in for a bite.	</TEXT><NOTE>By RICHARD LORANT</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PALMA DE MAJORCA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The families of Ramon Aguilo andMiquel Segura have been churchgoing Roman Catholics for threecenturies, but that didn't stop neighborhood kids from tauntingthem as Jews each day on the way to school.   Since they were old enough to remember, the two men have knowntheir neighbors viewed them as different.   Segura and Aguilo are Xuetas, descendants of 15 stigmatizedfamilies who survived a 1691 Spanish Inquisition crackdown against``lapsed'' Jewish converts to Christianity on this SpanishMediterranean island.   The Xueta (pronounced Chweta) phenomenon is an extreme exampleof a Spanish obsession with bloodlines that long outlasted theInquisition, a papal commission created in 1478 to root out secretJews, Moslems and other heretics.   The Xueta label has followed the two men into adulthood.   During a recent labor dispute, striking garbage collectors addedit to the list of insults they hurled at Aguilo, now the mayor ofthe capital city of Palma.   A few years ago, a news article showing the mayor donating bloodcarried the caption, ``Xueta blood? No thanks.''   Majorca's prosperous Jewish community, like those throughoutmedieval Spain, ceased to exist in 1492 when King Ferdinand andQueen Isabella issued an edict that gave Jews the choice ofconverting to Catholicism or fleeing the country.   Jews of Spanish descent began returning to Spain from NorthAfrica after World War II to join others who had fled Nazi-occupiedEurope. But it wasn't until 1968 that the regime of Gen. FranciscoFranco authorized the construction of a synagogue in Madrid andformally rescinded the 1492 expulsion edict.   Since most Spanish Jews changed their surnames when theyconverted, it is nearly impossible for modern Spaniards todetermine their origin, although many offhandedly claim some Jewishancesemother is a Jew of Polish origin.   Samuel Toledano, head of the Federation of Jewish Communities inSpain, says Spanish Catholics who recognize him from televisionappearances often approach him to proclaim their Jewish heritage.   Israel's first ambassador to Spain, Samuel Haddas, told aSpanish daily in 1986, ``not a day goes by that I don't get aletter or phone call from Spaniards asking if their surname isJewish.''   But in Majorca's closed island culture, people with the 15 Xuetasurnames have been singled out since 1691, when a Majorcan priestpublished The Triumphant Faith, in which the names appeared.   Until mass tourism began to dilute the island's culture andraise educational levels in the 1950s and 1960s, the Xuetasremained a community apart, ostracized by other Catholics andsteered into certain neighborhoods and professions _ most notablysilversmithing.   Now, half of Majorca's 600,000 residents are new to the island.There are no reliable figures on the number of Xuetas, but Seguraestimates there are between 15,000 and 30,000 on Majorca.   Few Xuetas still live on the Street of the Silver Shops, oncethe center of their neighborhood, although many of the stores stillbear Xueta names.   Aguilo, 39, and Segura, 44, say they belong to a transitionalgeneration _free of institutional anti-Xueta prejudices butsubjected to verbal abuse from their childhood peers.   ``The city has pretty much overcome this type of racism. Butcertain latent tendencies still exist, despite the growth oftourism,'' says Aguilo, an agnostic.   Segura, the head of the local jewelers' and silversmiths' guild,wears a heavy gold pendant showing a seven-branched Jewish menorahor candelabra and the Majorcan coat of arms as a symbol of pride.He says his children are generally unaffected by any lingeringprejudice.   Both are careful to point out that unlike the Spanish mainland,where centuries of anti-Jewish religious teachings and a physicalabsence of Jews gave anti-Semitism a nebulous quality, anti-Xuetafeelings on Majorca were directed at real people.   Descendants of other converts gradually integrated into Majorcansociety, their origin forgotten, and the Xueta surnames carry nostigma on the Spanish mainland.   ``This has nothing to do with the peninsula. It is an islandissue, prolonged by the insularity of Majorca,'' Segura says.   ``What existed here was not a historic or mythical prejudice. Itwas a real, live hatred _ it wasn't even aimed at Jews, but ratherat Xuetas.''   ``Here, religious prejudices became racial ones,'' Aguilo says.``The Xuetas are as Catholic as anybody else. To avoid suspicionthey were even more observant in public than others.''   Over the past 25 years, a few Xuetas have had an oppositereaction, converting to Judaism and moving to Israel.   There are no Xuetas among today's practicing Jewish communityhere. Most of its 160 members are northern European retirees.   They conduct their Friday night services in Hebrew and Englishat a 2-year-old synagogue tucked behind a high-rise Palma hotel,and depend on members or visiting clergymen to conduct services.   Jewish community president Henry Greenberg says he has seenlittle evidence of anti-Semitism on the island.   ``Majorca is free of anti-Semitism except for a few youngsterswho smear paint on the walls,'' says the British retiree. ``TheRoman Catholic bishop helped inaugurate our synagogue. Basically,it's a wonderful environment.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By ROBERT BARR</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Professor Archie Campbell peers intothe future and sees fish, a thousand tons of the sea's bountyheaped high on a magic cart gliding effortlessly above the floor.   Campbell is joking, but he and his colleagues in the newResearch Center in Superconductivity are well aware that theBritish government expects some practical, patentable return on itsinvestment.   ``We are in a bit of a glass house to see whether we can producesomething of interest to the public, and commercial firms inparticular,'' says Peter Duncumb, the center's director. ``I thinkthat's all to the good.''   Cambridge University, whose scientific tradition stretches fromSir Isaac Newton to Stephen Hawking, author of the contemporarybest seller, ``A Brief History of Time,'' seems the obvious choicefor the government's first venture in interdisciplinary researchcenters.   Appropriately, the center is in the new building of theCavendish Laboratory, famous for its pioneering work in splittingthe atom in the 1930s.   Superconductors have zero-resistance to electric currents anddefy gravity by repelling a magnetic field. But they now work onlyat the temperature of liquid nitrogen, about minus 390 degress F,which limits their potential.   The elusive room-temperature superconductor conjures up visionsof 2,000-mph trains, smaller and faster computers, electromagneticlaunchers to replace rockets. Visions, too, of bags and bags ofprofits.   The center is the first of nine interdisciplinary researchcenters established by the government, with an initial commitmentof $9.3 million for six years.   ``We're well-funded,'' Campbell says carefully, ``by Britishstandards.''   The U.S. government spends about $90 million a year onsuperconductivity research, and a White House advisory committeeproposes spending $30 million more.   Cambridge is sometimes thought of as the scientific half ofOxbridge, as Britain's two oldest and greatest universities areoften called. But Oxford, 70 miles to the southwest, is alsogetting an interdisciplinary research center _ in molecularsciences _ and Cambridge's literary heritage includes Milton,Marlowe, Wordsworth and Dryden.   Government grant reductions which led to Oxford's public appealfor funds have also been felt in the Cavendish Laboratory.   ``We have good people, so we can get research grants from theresearch councils, but the difficulty today is that the backup inthe case of laboratory space, technician support and generalrunning costs is no longer adequate,'' says John Deakin, secretaryto the department of physics and the Cavendish Laboratory.   Technicians, he says, have been lost to better-paid jobs inprivate industry in the Cambridge Science Park. Ironically, thepark is run by Trinity College and plows part of its profits backinto the university.   Denis Noble, professor of cardiovascular physiology at Oxfordand founder of the lobbying group Save British Science, says thatfunding is an old problem.   He cites the case of Charles Babbage, a Cambridge experimenterin mechanical calculators who lost his government funding in 1842.   ``The mind boggles to think that Britain might have had an IBMin the 19th century,'' Nobler says. ``We could have had a worldlead in that area.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By ROBERT BARR</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the fourth week of Hilary Term, theSunday sermon at the University Church of St. Mary the Virgin wason the grace of humility.   Humility has been preached to Oxford since 1684, under a piousbequest, though it is not so easily learned. ``To call a man anOxford man,'' the 19th-century prime minister W.E. Gladstone said,``is to pay him the highest compliment that can be paid to a humanbeing.''   In recent years, however, Oxford has been learning daily,practical lessons on the humility of reduced circumstances.   For the first time in 442 years, there is no Regius Professor ofGreek. The university said it couldn't afford to hire one, nor aRegius Professor of Ecclesiastical History.   There are 140 vacant teaching positions at Oxford and members ofthe Association of University Teachers, upset at not getting raisesthis year, are refusing to participate in final examinations.   The Oxford Playhouse closed for lack of funds in 1987, theBodleian Library is looking for $172,000 to buy acid-free cardboardboxes to store rare books, and the Oxford Union, where generationsof politicians have polished their sneers and ripostes, had to bebailed out by a Japanese donation.   Just as Oscar Wilde, as an Oxford undergraduate, found it``harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china,'' so theuniversity finds it increasingly difficult to live up to itsreputation. Now it has gone, hat-in-hand, to its fiercelyindependent colleges, to wealthy corporations and alumni.   ``The university now is not filling five out of six vacancies,''says Henry Drucker, an American academic who directs the UniversityDevelopment Office's campaign to raise about $385 million withinfive years. The goal includes $70 million for an endowment.   ``We are not in any way replacing our stock of old people, whoare all getting fed up and cheesed off,'' says Rosemary Fennell,secretary of the Oxford chapter of the teachers association, whichrepresents about one-third of the faculty.   Throughout the university system, the number of faculty membersunder the age of 35 has fallen from 29 percent to 15 percent in thelast decade.   ``Education is undervalued in this society,'' Ms. Fennell says.   ``I think the government has some responsibility, for thelong-term fabric of society, to insure that you have awell-educated citizenry, and that you are doing the primaryresearch. And who's going to fund Sanskrit?''   Despite its manifest wealth of architecture and the riches ofits libraries, Oxford shares in a funding squeeze which affects allof Britain's university system. The number of students nationwidehas dipped 3 percent since 1982, and the institutions project acombined five-year deficit of $128 million by 1992.   Oxford has begun giving merit raises of up to 30 percent foroutstanding teachers, but Cambridge University believes it can keepits best and brightest on annual salaries averaging about $47,600.   Cambridge is attempting to cut its faculty by 5 percent.   Oxford has the distinction of educating the architects of thisnew era: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Education SecretaryKenneth Baker, who envisions ``market-led, multifunded'' highereducation.   In practical terms, that means a greater dependence on privatesupport, loans instead of grants for students, and even talk about``privatizing'' the universities.   Symptoms of distress are hidden and Oxford remains, to thevisitor, what the poet John Keats called ``the finest city in theworld.''   The days of peaches, cream and champagne have not ended. Theyare dished out every year to heads of houses and other nobs as thebenefaction of Lord Crewe, a 17th-century bishop.   Birdsong and the distant tolling of bells still soothe thewanderer beyond Christ Church Meadow, which commands anunobstructed view of the ``dreaming spires'' celebrated by MatthewArnold, though the whine of traffic on the High Street may shattera reverie even there.	
</TEXT><NOTE>By ROBERT BYRD</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tucked into a wooded corner of Emory University'ssuburban campus, the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center haslong exuded an air of mystery.   Security fences and ``Private Property'' signs greet those whofind their way down a winding two-lane road behind Emory dorms andoffices, through the woods, past a secluded lake.   Here for years white-coated scientists have labored quietly tofind, through study and experimentation with monkeys and apes,answers to health problems that plague humans.   But now there's an us-against-them feeling at Yerkes. Theresearchers' pride in their accomplishments is tempered byfrustration, anger and even fear. A growing band of crusaders wouldlike nothing more than to shut the center down.   ``I wasn't hired to do this, you know,'' grumbles Dr. FrederickA. King Jr., having to explain to yet another reporter the stepsYerkes takes to conduct its research as humanely as possible.   King, an outspoken advocate of animal research and the directorof Yerkes for a decade, has been the target of death threats. Hiscenter, an arm of Emory University and one of seven regional primateresearch centers sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, hasbeen the site of numerous protests by animal rights activists.   Last December, 12 people were arrested on the Emory campus in ademonstration against the use of animals in scientific research, thesecond such protest in a month. Three of those arrested loweredthemselves on ropes down the front of a six-story building andunfurled a huge banner reading ``Save the Yerkes Chimps.'' The othernine tried to block the university's main gate. Members of theCalifornia-based group In Defense of Animals said the protest markedthe beginning of a two-year campaign against centers like Yerkes.   Elsewhere in the nation, buildings have been burned and animalrights activists have been arrested with bombs. Yerkes staffers saythey sometimes wonder about their personal safety.   King says he has ``good reason to believe'' that virtually everyinstitution like his has been infiltrated by animal-rights activists.   But his chief worry, King says, is that the animal rightsmovement could diminish the effectiveness of the center, a placewhere new techniques for treating Parkinson's disease were found,where ape communication studies led to new ways of teaching retardedchildren.   ``What I am afraid of,'' he says, ``is that these people may getbills passed in Congress, regulations passed through federalagencies, that could be terribly, terribly injurious to research,terribly restrictive and costly beyond belief.   ``That's my fear, that they will whittle us down _ not that theywill knock us out of the box. By their acts of violence andterrorism, breaking, entering, bomb threats, destroying property,stealing animals, falsifying photographs of this and that, they costus a hell of a lot of money.''   The center, named for its founder, Dr. Robert M. Yerkes, aprimate research pioneer, has three locations: the main station,with labs and offices; a southeast Atlanta language lab, and thefield station, a spartan 117 acres in suburban Gwinnett County where1,500 primates _ from 1,000 rhesus monkeys to a small family ofpygmy chimpanzees _ live in two dozen separately housed groups.   Add to that 13 gorillas and a dozen orangutans at Zoo Atlantaunder an unusual and popular arrangement.   The Zoo Atlanta project, in which primates roam in open-airapproximations of their original habitats, has spurred an ambitiousrenovation plan that has brought the once-beleaguered zoo new-foundrespect and thousands of new visitors.   It's also good public relations for Yerkes, as it presents thecenter's name to happy zoo visitors gazing at cuddly lookingcreatures.   It's also an ongoing research effort. Yerkes scientists continueto study the behavior and reproduction of the gorillas andorangutans at the zoo. In particular, Yerkes staffers and Atlantansin general hope that Zoo Atlanta mainstay, Willie B., a gorilla whospent nearly three decades in a cage, will settle down with a Yerkesfemale in his new outdoor playground and have little Willies.   But most of the Yerkes animals are at the field station, a largesite once out in the country, but now rapidly being surrounded bysubdivisions.   It is there, amid heated concrete shelters and fenced-in pens,that some 30 research scientists and animal care technicians workwith sooty mangabeys, squirrel monkeys, chimps, and that staple ofresearch labs, rhesus monkeys.   On a recent winter's day, field station coordinator and researchprofessor Tom Gordon, strolled up to a gymnasium-size pen housinghundreds of rhesus monkeys and started calling them by name.   ``You get to know them after a while,'' he says.   Yerkes scientists continually observe the monkeys, looking fornew behavioral characteristics. Even in the largest colonies, onemonkey is king, and a social hierarchy flows downward from him, hismate and her offspring, with other families acting subservient.   While some of the rhesus colony are taken from time to time forlab experiments at the main station, others live on at the fieldstation for generations in an ongoing behavioral study.   Another primate group getting a great deal of attention at thefield station these days is a collection of sooty mangabeys who, asit turns out, are almost universally infected with SIV _ simianimmunodeficiency virus, a close cousin of HIV, or humanimmunodeficiency virus, the killer virus that causes AIDS.   Most primates infected with SIV will become ill, as do humansinfected with HIV. But for some reason, the sooty mangabeys, for themost part, never become clinically ill.	</TEXT><NOTE>By ROBERT GLASS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Senate arepreparing for the first vote in more than 20 years on whether thistropical island of 3.3 million Spanish-speaking people will becomethe 51st state.   A plebiscite planned for 1991 would allow Puerto Rico to decidewhether to remain a U.S. commonwealth, break away to form anindependent nation or become the first state admitted to the Unionsince Alaska and Hawaii in 1959.   Under a bill approved by a Senate committee on Aug. 3, theplebiscite would be self-executing; that is, the U.S. government forthe first time would agree in advance to accept whatever statusPuerto Ricans choose.   ``It's never been tackled this way before,'' Gov. RafaelHernandez Colon said in an interview. ``It's a historical first.''   President Bush endorsed the plebiscite proposal in his State ofthe Union message in February and said he backed statehood forPuerto Rico. However, the bill received committee approval by anarrow vote _ 11-7 _ indicating it could run into trouble in thefull Senate and House of Representatives.   Of the three options, only independence appears to have norealistic chance of winning. But the plebiscite proposal hasrekindled anti-colonial sentiment. The biggest pro-independencerally in recent history and a series of minor bombings coincidedwith Senate hearings in San Juan in June.   Hernandez Colon, who advocates continuation of the 37-yearcommonwealth arrangement, but with more autonomy, proposed theplebiscite in his inaugural address in January at the start of hissecond consecutive four-year term.   He says a referendum, the first since 1967, is needed to settlethe deeply divisive status issue, which has dominated Puerto Rico'spolitical debate virtually since Spain ceded the Caribbean island tothe United States in 1898 at the end of the Spanish-American War.   As the home of Roosevelt Roads Naval Base, one of the world'slargest, Puerto Rico is strategically important. But successiveadministrations have said Puerto Ricans should have the right todetermine their own fate.   ``This issue goes to the very heart of our system of government,to the principles of self-determination and of government by theconsent of the governed,'' Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairmanof the Senate's Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said inintroducing enabling legislation.   If Puerto Rico became a state, it would be by far the poorest andthe only one with Spanish as its main language. With its Spanishheritage, customs, literature, salsa and merengue music and itslocation in the Caribbean, it would also be a state with adistinctly Latin American flavor.   But after nearly 100 years of U.S. dominance and with more than 2million Puerto Ricans living in the States, the island isunmistakably American. U.S. post offices, the dollar, shoppingmalls, and 31 Burger Kings in the San Juan metropolitan area aloneare just a few of the reminders.   ``We're Latin Americans perhaps in our music, in our language,but we're Americans in many ways in our daily lives,'' says CarlosRomero Barcelo, a former governor and leader of the statehood party.``In our attitudes, in our political heritage, we're definitelyAmerican.''   Yet, Puerto Ricans retain a strong sense of national identity.Politicians invariably refer to Puerto Rico as a ``pais,'' orcountry, and the people take pride in having their own Olympic teamand Miss Universe contestant.   Under the commonwealth, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and areeligible for military service, food stamps and most other benefitsavailable to other Americans. However, they pay no federal taxes andcannot vote for president.   Although Puerto Rico is self-governing, it has no control overimmigration, international trade or defense. The island sends nosenators or congressmen to Washington, only a non-voting residentcommissioner.	</TEXT><NOTE>By ROBERT GLASS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The grand old man of Puerto Rico'sstatehood movement is Luis A.

At 85, the venerated ``Don Luis'' is still going strong,overseeing his charitable foundation and chasing an ideal that haseluded him over a political career spanning nearly half a century:U.S. statehood for Puerto Rico.   ``I knew that this was going to take time,'' he said in aninterview a few days before flying to Washington for Senate hearingson Puerto Rico's future relationship with the United States. ``Itwas a question of waiting for the thing to evolve to the propertime.''   Ferre says that time has finally come, and predicts a referendumplanned for 1991 will see a 60-percent majority in favor ofabandoning Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. commonwealth and makingthe Caribbean island the 51st state.   Ferre has played a prominent role in Puerto Rican politics sinceWorld War II. He was a member of the assembly that produced the 1952constitution, founded the pro-statehood New Progressive Party in1967 and was governor from 1969 to 1972. Today, he is chairman ofthe island's Republican Party.   Yet, his most enduring work may be his philanthropy, and inparticular the Ponce Museum of Art, which London's Financial Timescalled ``one of the most distinguished private collections in theWestern Hemisphere outside the United States.''   Ferre opened the museum in Ponce, his birthplace in southernPuerto Rico, in 1959 with 120 of his own paintings. Today, it houses500 paintings, including several noted pre-Raphaelites, along withhundreds of sculptures and artifacts, with a total estimated valueof $50 million.   Ferre's grandfather was a French engineer who worked on thePanama Canal before settling in Cuba. His father, Antonio, moved toPuerto Rico as a young man and married Maria Aguayo Casals, a cousinof the Spanish cellist Pablo Casals, who lived in Puerto Rico.   Ferre studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, where he was captain of the fencing team.   He also trained at the New England Conservatory of Music. He isan accomplished classical pianist, occasionally performing inpublic, and still tries to put in a few hours of practice every day.   It was during his university days, Ferre said, that he developeda passion for the ``American way of democracy'' and eventualstatehood for Puerto Rico.   On his return to the island, Ferre got a job as an engineer atthe Puerto Rico Iron Works. Later, he and a brother, Joseph, foundedthe Puerto Rico Cement Co. in Ponce, the source of the family'swealth.   In his first philanthropic venture, Ferre founded the PoncePublic Library in 1937. At about the same time, he bought the city'snewspaper, El Dia, which was in danger of folding. ``My theory wasthat a city without a newspaper is a city without a soul,'' he says.   When he became governor, Ferre sold the newspaper to his son,Antonio, who moved it to San Juan. It is now the pro-statehood ElNuevo Dia, one of the biggest of Puerto Rico's four dailies.	</TEXT><NOTE>By ROBERT MACY</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It takes a lot of chutzpah to close downa busy section of Interstate 15, orchestrate a simulated shootoutin a crowded airport lobby, or fake the firebombing of a casino onthe Las Vegas Strip.   But for a former New York model, such challenges have becomeroutine.   Christine O'Rourke, who saw dreams of a modeling career derailed19 years ago, now runs the only licensed movie casting and locationmanagement company in Nevada.   In that role, she finds her ingenuity tested almost daily byHollywood producers, taking part in the production of films such as``Rain Man,'' which won the Oscar as the best picture of 1988,``Midnight Run,'' ``Heat,'' ``Starman'' and the television series``Crime Story.''   Her toughest assignment was setting up a scene in which a casinowas firebombed _ a near impossible feat in a city where gamingexecutives are skittish about even having photographs taken intheir establishments.   The firebombing was shot for one of the episodes of the TVseries ``Crime Story.''   ``We had to clear everything through security, deal with firecodes, get clearance of city and county officials, etc.,'' O'Rourkerecalls, sitting in an office lined with autographed photos ofstars with whom she's worked. ``We had to practice the scene, thenshut down the entire casino operation to make it work.''   Another scene involved tossing a Molotov cocktail in arestaurant.   ``It takes a lot of finesse to get an owner to let you dosomething like that,'' she says, laughing.   She found herself enlisting the aid of the governor's office inclosing a section of I-15, the main artery between Las Vegas andLos Angeles, to film a scene for ``Starman.''   On other occasions, has cleared a mountain of legal and publicrelations problems to close down sections of the Las Vegas Stripand downtown's Glitter Gulch.   ``You've got to get the approval of every casino owner who'saffected,'' she explains. ``You've got to go to all the propertyowners, even the guy who runs the hot dog stand and the owner ofthe pawnshop. If just one of them says no, it's my job to convincethem it would be good for them.''   O'Rourke handled the Nevada locations and casting of extras for``Rain Man.''   But she found ``Midnight Run'' one of her toughest challenges,especially a scene filmed at McCarran International Airport in LasVegas.   ``These people were sticklers for realism,'' she recalls. ``Theywanted real cops, real FBI agents. They said, `If you can't get usreal cops and FBI men, we'll find someone who can.'''   O'Rourke found herself calling powerful Clark County SheriffJohn Moran in the pre-dawn hours one day to enlist his aid in thesearch for extras. She delivered, and the airport scene, involving400 extras, was one of the more dramatic segments of the hit film.   The airport scene was not without its problems.   She blocked off the ticketing counters at the busy facility,filming overnight when traffic was lightest.   ``We had signs up to indicate we were filming, but it stillcaused a scene when someone shouted, `Look out, he's got a gun,'and everyone started pulling guns,'' she says.   Martin Sheen needed soldiers in his upcoming movie``Nightbreaker.'' The extras were to portray American servicemenused in atmospheric nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site in the1950s. Veterans have contended they were subjected to radioactivefallout from the testing, a charge denied by the government.   The sensitive nature of the film ruled out government agenciesas a source for the extras. So O'Rourke recruited high school andcollege ROTC students to provide the needed manpower.   She enlisted the aid of the principal at her children'selementary school when a producer wanted two Eskimo kids, aRussian-looking youngster, and a 10-year-old Mr. T look-alike.   The heady world of Hollywood was something of a naturalprogression for O'Rourke, 38, who began modeling in her hometown ofSan Jose, Calif. at the age of 15. She headed for New York City twoyears later, modeling for magazines such as ``Seventeen.''   That career came to a halt when she married at the age of 19. Adivorce, then a move to Las Vegas nine years ago found hersearching for a new career while trying to support her children,Patrick, 13, and Tara, 12.   She started Spectrum Services, her location and casting company,on less than $100.   The use of Nevada locations in filming motion pictures isgrowing annually, with direct film revenues to the state topping$50 million last year _ 10 times the revenues generated five yearsago.   Much of Nevada's recent success in wooing Hollywood producerscan be attributed to Robert Hirsch and his state Motion PictureDivision.   Las Vegas offers many attractive features for filmmakers,O'Rourke says.   ``This is a 24-hour town,'' she says. ``You can film anytime ofthe day or night. There's a lot of lore and history. It's anattractive area.   ``And Nevada is something of a last frontier. It's the laststate where you can come in and do a tremendous amount of thingswithout a lot of red tape.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By SAUL PETT</NOTE><NOTE>AP Special Correspondent</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   He goes as he came, possibly the mosteffervescent politician of the dying decade.   To effervesce, Mr. Webster says, is to ``bubble and hiss.'' Ifanything, the unretiring retiring mayor of New York now leavesoffice after 12 noisy years with more bubble than hiss.   ``God has been very nice to me,'' Ed Koch concludes, withoutsuggesting that God ever got a single word in edgewise.   American leaders cross the bridge from power to private life ina variety of moods. Ulysses S. Grant worried about money. WilliamHoward Taft felt like a ``giant locomotive suddenly pulling a toytrain.'' Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter felt dejected and rejected.   Ed Koch was also rejected by the voters but not _ never _ by EdKoch. He sounds like the happiest lame duck in the pond.   He says he no longer feels like Sisyphus of Greek mythology,trying every day to push a huge boulder up a mountain and everyday, near the top, watching it roll back down.   ``But now, now I'm crossing over into the promised land!'' hesays, arms akimbo, grinning to his ears, little brown eyes dancing,bald pate dazzling in the reflected light of a new dawn.   ``No more decisions. I don't have to alienate anybody. SuddenlyI'm popular again. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe revisionism issetting in early. But even the columnists who reviled me unfairlyare saying nice things.   ``The job of mayor could shorten your life. God extended mine. Icame through that stroke two years ago with no diminution offaculties. Mother Teresa prayed for my full recovery, and she is apowerful person.   ``I am a lucky man. I can sing and dance. I can walk and talk.''   Encountering no resistance to that last verb, Koch said he waslooking forward to the practice of law, lecturing around thecountry, teaching at New York University, writing a column for theNew York Post and doing TV and radio commentary. All in all, he isexpected to avoid the poverty line by about $500,000 a year.   In a farewell interview with The Associated Press, Koch spokewarmly of the New York police. During his tenure, he went to 50police funerals and wept, and as his days in City Hall dwindleddown, he tried to visit every one of the city's police precinctsduring shape-up to thank them and say goodbye.   He told them his plans and offered to help anybody who thoughtKoch could be of help as a private citizen. He had pictures takenwith them. Now and then a policeman stepped forward, made a littlesentimental speech and gave the departing mayor a present, like asweat shirt.   Koch leaves a lovely, muted office in a corner of City Hall,gently decorated with graceful paintings, comfortable furniture anda restrained number of pictures taken with foreign dignitaries. Theroom suggested little connection with the raucous world outside.Here, the mayor received visitors in shirt sleeves and, usually, infull gallop.   The job of mayor of New York is often called the second toughestin the country. Had this mayor ever thought of going for thetoughest?   ``No.''   Not even one teensy passing thought about becoming the firstJewish president of the United States?   ``No, no, no. It's never been part of my life's goals. I swear,it never entered my mind that it was doable. Running for governor(and losing) was foolish enough.''   City Hall, he insists, was pinnacle enough, and he leaves ``on ahigh,'' proud he was one of only three men to serve three terms,confident of his place in history, feeling in no way a loser orignored. He says Fiorello La Guardia was New York's greatest mayorbut didn't become that in people's minds until years after heserved.   As for his own record, ``I'm proud of bringing fiscal stabilityback to the city, of returning a spirit people had lost when wefelt like beggars under (predecessors) Abe Beame and John Lindsay.I gave people back a sense of themselves and a sense of humor and asense of getting things done.''   He closes out 25 years of public service as district leader,city councilman, member of Congress and mayor. Still, he does notfear decompression leaving power and the march of great events. Heis particularly confident he will not have to fight back tearsleaving reporters.   He says he took much unfair abuse from the media in the kind ofcoverage that keeps good people from running for public office. Heparticularly will not miss six columnists he doesn't name who, hesays, wrote with one voice like ``clones of each other.'' He saidthey actually took part in political campaigns to defeat him.   ``Because I'm such a powerful personality, I gave life back toCity Hall, made it relevant again. I exercised the power of anoffice that had gone into eclipse. And so I was blamed if a sparrowfell anywhere in the city.''   Six large sparrows were convicted of corruption during Koch'stenure. ``Each was like a dagger in my heart, and I'll never getover it. In this respect, I think my administration was equal tothe best but we got the worst attacks from the press. In Lindsay'stime, the entire police force was corrupt. One of his commissionerseven sold a reservoir to organized crime.''   Oh, yes, Koch is doing another book, which reminds him of thetime a Brooklyn rabbi was showing him around. There, the rabbipointed, is the biggest library on Jews in the world.   Koch: Do you have my books?   Rabbi: Which ones?   Koch: ``Mayor,'' ``Politics'' and ``His Eminence and Hizzoner''(written with Cardinal John O'Connor in alternating chapters).   Rabbi: We'll take the first two.   Koch: Why not the third?   Rabbi: You know we can't have his book in our library.   Koch: You could tell your people to read every other chapter.	</TEXT><NOTE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The tough-talking new boss of the Chicago HousingAuthority is determined to drive gang members and drug dealers outof the projects even if it means stepping on the toes of some of thetenants and upsetting some civil libertarians.   ``It's like squeezing an orange, a door-to-door squeeze,'' saysVince Lane, who last year took over as chairman of the CHA, whose 18complexes are home to 150,000 people.   ``I want them out. I want to keep them out.''   His tactics have included unannounced police sweeps of theprojects and searches of many apartments, prompting a lawsuit by theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.   Lane's efforts may rankle some tenants, but they yielded a13-percent drop in the crime rate over the final seven months of1988.   Lane, 47, has a master's degree in business administration fromthe University of Chicago. He drinks herbal tea for lunch and readsLee Iacocca books in his spare time.   A divorced former developer and entrepreneur, Lane is accustomedto getting his way and considers himself anything but a civilservant. His supporters call that an asset. His critics call it adetriment.   ``I think some of the things he's done have been questionablelegally, but they've been understandable _ in dealing with thesocial decay, the frustration of tenants,'' says Gary Orfield,professor of public policy at the University of Chicago. ``It's alot better than doing nothing.''   For example, at Rockwell Gardens _ the most dangerous CHAdevelopment where eight in 100 residents were reported robbed,raped, assaulted or murdered in 1987 _ the crime rate dropped 32percent.   Ironically, Lane says, the over-all crime statistics rose aspeople became less afraid to report crimes and as gangs, pushed outof their territories by the sweeps, went to battle rivals forcontrol of remaining domains.   Despite the improvements at Rockwell, living there is no picnic.   ``It's kind of tough,'' says Antonio Woods, 14, as he and a groupof youngsters cruised the project grounds one afternoon. ``You don'tknow what's going to happen. You don't know who comes up to you.''   Woods lives in a Rockwell building recently sand-blasted toremove graffiti and secured by door monitors who check theidentification cards of anyone entering the building. When Lanevisited the building recently, some residents shouted ``Stop thelockdown'' as he passed by.   ``It's like jail,'' Woods says, acknowledging his ambivalencetoward the arrangement.   Random shootings on the playground have stopped, but life isstill far from perfect, say Woods and his friends. ``We need a newplayground with some basketball rims,'' he says.   Lane would like to see that happen, with a plan that comes fromchildhood memories. In the 1950s, he lived across the street from ahousing project on Chicago's South Side.   ``They had neat, nice basketball courts, swimming pools, thewhole bit,'' he says. ``It was far preferable to where I lived.''   Swimming pools might be pushing it, he says. But his realisticprograms call for grass instead of mud-caked lawns, flowers insteadof weeds and resident programs instead of gang activity. Much ofthose programs is to come from resident-organized groups financiallyindependent of the housing authority.   ``Right now, gangs are the only organized activity for youngpeople,'' he says. ``When residents are able to not worry aboutstaying alive, they will actively participate in any other activityof a normal community.''   Jack Kemp, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment, has called Lane's plans a model for the nation. Butpraise is more forthcoming than money.   ``He has a lot of ways and ideas that are not orthodox for publichousing, and those unorthodox methods get people's attention,'' saysGertrude Jordan, regional director of HUD, which funds the majorshare of CHA's $150 million annual budget.	</TEXT><NOTE>By SID MOODY</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``You probably ought to go see LeoSchwab,'' said the phoner, a member of Silicon Valley's vastbrotherhood of computer hackers. ``He's a wizard. Even wears acape.''   So, off to see the wizard, following if not the Yellow Brick Roadthe _ too good to be true _ Golden Gate Bridge en route.   The wizard, capeless, opened the door of a brand-new suburbantown house. His lair _ absent clouds of steam or a wizardlyswitching panel _ was equipped with California wall hangings andlaid-back furniture. Schwab himself, lanky-tall, whose unlined faceof 24 years was framed by an auburn beard, was further deflationary:   ``I'm not a wizard. Maybe a semi-wizard.''   Schwab was to demonstrate, however, that he could make a computer_ essentially only an electronic box that can either say yes or no _pirouette magically under his spell.   ``Computers consume almost all my waking hours,'' said Schwab,whose ``sleep phase'' runs from about 3 a.m. to 10 a.m.   This is one of the identifying field marks of the hacker breed.Dedicated, long, oddball hours.   ``I want to write software and make a lot of money (a common butnot always present field mark of a hacker) and (almost an invariablehallmark of the species) have fun.''   Fun at the expense of the nation's computer networks thattransfer billions of dollars of bank money daily, monitor heartbeatsin hospitals, command satellites in space, switch all those zillionsof phone calls, is not what hacking is about. Hackers resent beinggrouped with those who maliciously plant worms and viruses thatbefuddle computers. Hackers call them crackers.   Schwab has been too engrossed getting a unicycle to juggle redballs on a computer screen to waste time goosing Ma Bell.   Leo's apotheosis to semi-wizardry is not untypical.   He's a native of the San Francisco Bay area where kids absorb thebinary system almost before they learn to stay afloat in hot tubs.Hacking, of course, is now worldwide, but its Bethlehem was at MITin Cambridge, Mass., and then Silicon Valley. Leo's father was amechanic, his mother a housewife. They produced a Leo gifted with avivid imagination.   ``I talked to myself a lot and daydreamed, usually with me in thestarring role.''   Once upon a time, wizardry at an early age was apt to getchannelized into such nerdy outlets as violin lessons ordifferential calculus on a slide rule. Fortunately for Leo, hisbirth coincided roughly with that of the personal computer where themaster could fulfill his dreams on the wondrous keyboard of anelectronic slave.   If you could afford one. Leo couldn't.   But the Byte Shop had just become Marin County's first computerstore. Leo became its first ``pest'' or embryonic wizard aliasfreeloading hacker.   ``They were permissive. They let me run anything. I played Pongin color on an Apple. Amazing! It was a black art then.''   In the ninth grade Leo was introduced to the computer lab at SanRafael High. ``I spent every spare moment there. I wanted to realizethings in my imagination on the screen. I had a lot of kooky ideas Icouldn't realize in other ways. I rarely achieved this because mymind was three years ahead of the technology.''   Leo made do buying $6 disk drives for Paleozoic computers whilewaiting for the industry to catch up. He meanwhile devised his firstcomputer game while daydreaming in algebra class.   ``Then I graduated and suddenly was without a machine. AComputerland threw me out for the last time.''   What was an apprentice wizard to do?   Leo had had a newspaper route. ``Everyone on it found their paperprecisely where they wanted it. Every day.''   Such diligence had earned him the scratch to buy a $1,200Commodore computer when they first came out. Computer games had beensweeping the country, making their teen-age inventors almost as richas rock stars or junk bond salesmen.   The computer's combination of speed, programmability and endlesspermutations makes it a natural for games by quick minds. One of thefirst was concocted in the late 1950s by the three young programmersat Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. The idea of the game, dubbedCore War, was to wipe out the memory of an opponent's computer. Allin fun, of course.   One of the players, ironically, was Robert Morris, whose son issuspected of having infected a major computer network last fall inwhat he may have thought was a hack but others think a crack.   In the '70s, computer games did for electronics what the rumbleseat once did for necking. Everyone wanted to try out the newtechnology. By the original Hacker Ethic evolved first at MIT anddescribed by Steven Levy in his landmark history, ``Hackers,''computers were a gift from the gods to man's ingenuity and should bethus forevermore free. Money got its nose in the tent, however, withthe rage for game software, Donkey Pong, Pac-Man, Frogger.   Levy describes how Ken Williams, a college dropout, came to foundOn-Line Systems in the Sierra foothills where pubescent andpost-adolescent programmers created fun and games in an atmosphereof anarchy and funny-smelling smoke so laid-back it risked topplinginto the Pacific. Bob Davis, a one-time musician and hash-housecook, signed on after meeting Williams in a liquor store where hewas working and taught himself to become a wizard game programmer.   John Harris, facing a nerdified future as son of a banker in SanDiego, came of age just as games did and went to work for On-Linewith a more generous royalty agreement than salary. One of his gamesat one point paid him $36,000 in royalties in a single month.   Leo Schwab just missed the gold rush.	</TEXT><NOTE>By SID MOODY</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><TEXT>   Horses, they have track records. Right there in the racing form.   Won. Lost. Sire.

Shakespeare's Marc Antony says, ``...the good is oft interredwith their bones...''   No offense, Will, but the good STUFF is ALWAYS interred withtheir bones.   Take the late Col. Fraser Moffat. The alumni magazine of his almamater paid due respect to his business and military career. Butnowhere did it mention that well into life he could still balance adozen empty beer bottles end on end.   The father of a colleague gave his own father last rites threetimes, unnecessarily as it turned out. Being about 10, he didn'texactly know procedure so he tried three different versions tospread-eagle possibilities. Think that stopped any presses? Nope. Hewas publicly remembered, albeit justly, for managing restaurants.   Obits will list survivors, but rarely, unless you're a rulingmonarch, ancestors. There's a happy housewife I met in Californiawho has survived descent from Jesse and Frank James, the YoungersAND the Daltons without robbing nary a bank. Not obit material inspite of what it may tell us about the sins of the father or evendead cousins.   In life we are surrounded by ``what ifs'' and other narrowescapes. Not in death. I had an uncle whose father promised to takehim to the new nickelodeon for his 10th birthday. The morning of thegreat event he had sniffles. His mother, a no-nonsenseex-schoolteacher, wouldn't let him out of the house. That's why hewasn't sitting in a reserved front row seat when the IroquoisTheater burned down in Chicago in 1903 killing 602 people. Hisescape never made the prints until now.   So how come obits never say what made us cry at the funeral andlaugh at the wake?   Alumni magazines are particularly remiss. Most of 'em just say``deceased.'' But part of the news is how our old pals departed thisrealm and what they'd done since we last saw them pouring milk punchover their heads at senior houseparties. Did they make ahole-in-one? Win a lottery? Scale K2?   Did they die in a bar fight in the Klondike? Lose a duel to ajealous husband? Did their parachutes fail to open? Don't ask theobit.   There's a tradition at Princeton University for freshmen to tryand climb up the ivy at Nassau Hall and steal the clapper from thebell so everyone will have an excuse for not getting to 8 o'clockclass on time. Well, I know a guy who not only got the clapper, healso found out where they hid all the spare clappers and pinchedthem, too. Obit matter? You kidding?   Last words get dropped from our lives as well. When Henrik Ibsen,the Norwegian playwright, lay dying, his night nurse told the daynurse the patient seemed to be slightly better.   ``Tvertimod,'' gasped the failing Ibsen. In English that says,``On the contrary.'' Obits never give us a chance to say, ``Solong.''   To clinch my case I give you Jack Bainton and the cow business.   Who?   John William Bainton. Friend. Dead the other day, age 63. ``Athis death Mr. Bainton was...'' That's what the obit said in twografs of a large metropolitan daily. OK, that paper's obit page isharder to get into than heaven, so they may be forgiven for notgetting the rest of the story. But there's no sense waiting aroundfor Paul Harvey to come up with it.   John William Bainton was born in Brooklyn. If Brooklyn were anOriental bazaar, Mr. Bainton would have ended up selling flyingcarpets that turned into 747s. Maybe your sister married the type. Avisionary. Early on.   Right after World War II there was a restriction on exportingnon-essential vehicles to a war-impoverished world. So Mr. Baintonwhitewashed some station wagons, painted red crosses on them andshipped them to Brazil as ambulances _until one day there was acloudburst in Recife. He assured authorities he would never do itagain, and didn't. But they never found out about the ambulancesthat had gone to Turkey where it never rains.   After selling the idea of centrifuging to the Peruvians to helpmake them one of the world's leading fish-meal producers, Mr.Bainton settled in the Bahamas helping advise one of Canada'srichest men what to do with 3,000 acres he owned, since you canbuild just so many resorts and golf courses.   Build a dairy, said Mr. Bainton, while everyone else laughedbecause the land was coral and prickly bushes. Based on his ownresearch, plus a hunch that defied conventional geology, he claimedthere would be soil underneath the coral. He was right. So what todo with the coral? Build a rock-crushing plant to extract the limeto build the cinder-block houses Bahamians live in. Then find cowsthat prosper in the semitropics, plant crops and start milking.   The Bahamas at the time imported 95 percent of its milk fromMiami, so by the time it arrived in the islands, it was already aday toward sour. Mr. Bainton's dairy eventually was producing almostas much milk as the Bahamians could drink.   He later had a business that made bricks out of garbage,pioneered in embryo implants to improve cattle breeds and proposedmaking a massive banana plantation in Oyster Bay, N.Y., under theworld's largest greenhouse, heated by a refuse incinerator. He nevergot around to building the power plant he figured would have lit upall Nassau by producing electricity from the up-welling thermalcurrents in the ocean.   ``Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,'' wrote the poetThomas Gray after ruminating in a country graveyard.

Luhrs' time of 80 days 20 hours from New York to San Franciscobeat a record that had stood since 1854, when Millard Fillmore hadjust turned over the White House to Franklin Pierce, France had anemperor and the world's first oil well was still five years away.   The old mark of 89 days eight hours had held off challengers for135 years. It had been set by the clipper Flying Cloud, amasterpiece of master shipbuilder Donald McKay, which was navigatedby the skipper's wife, Mrs. Josiah Creesy, with Himself at the helm.   Creesy, his 40-odd member crew and his passengers were in a rushbecause there was gold in California. His cargo could fetch $1 anegg and $40 for a quart of whiskey.   Clipper ships, the greyhounds of the sea, were built for speed.Anything fast in those days could be called a clipper. Clippersleds. Clipper buggies.   McKay, a native of Nova Scotia, turned out swift, sharp-prowedand daringly overcanvased fliers at his yard in East Boston. Therewere to be 14 instances when a tall ship logged more than 400 milesin 24 hours. Ten were McKay creations including the fastest,Champion of the Seas, which once covered 465 miles in a day's run.   Flying Cloud, in fact, broke her own record in 1854. Three yearsearlier, with her white and gold goddess figurehead cutting thewaves, Flying Cloud sped around the Horn with Eleanor Creesynavigating past the rocks and through snow and gales to beat the oldrecord by more than a week. The crew, who had blown out severaltopmasts under Creesy's iron rule _ that time was money and speedadvertising of the finest kind, promptly deserted for the goldfields.   The clipper era was actually short-lived and marked the lastundisputed primacy of the American merchant marine. Americanclippers in the opium trade to China set speed records all over theworld. Their names were as glorious as the ships: Comet, Eagle Wing,Westward Ho, Sovereign of the Seas, Young America, Sea Witch. (SeaWitch sailed from Hong Kong to New York in 74 days 14 hours in 1849).   In getting to California pronto in the 1850s to pan gold in theSierras there was no lesser of evils. Overland there were Indiansand deserts and mountains. Transshipping across the Isthmus ofPanama there were malaria and yellow fever. Around the Horn therewas ... the Horn.   Rounding the Horn is like walking up a dark alley at midnightwith the Cape being the mugger. Rounding it east to west isparticularly life-shortening because the westerlies whirl unimpededaround the world goaded by incessant storms into some of the mostawesome waves in the world. A sailing vessel could spend a monthbattling gales to double the Cape. Some gave up and turned around tosail to the Orient via the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa. Aspeed merchant like the frosty-tempered Creesy keeping his foot tothe pedal only made the hazards greater.   The Americans had another unsung hero, Matthew Fontaine Maury.Maury was a Navy lieutenant who had been beached due to a leginjury, so he was given a berth as superintendent of the sleepyDepartment of Charts and Instruments.   He began collecting log books from as many voyages as he couldfind and gradually drew up charts of wind patterns and currents.Armed with these, Americans became, briefly, monarchs of the oceans.The era didn't last because the Civil War concentrated the nation'senergies away from the sea and because of the development of theironclad steamboat. McKay's last clipper, the Glory of the Seaslaunched in 1868, ended her days as a frozen fish warehouse.   About the only glory remaining were the old clipper records.   Records and the seas have always conspired to lure mankind out ofhis easy chair. The Blue Ribband for the fastest time was always acoveted trophy in the heyday of the trans-Atlantic liners. Butyachtsmen, if they ventured on the high seas at all, usually enduredcold, wet and hunger until they reached distant ports at the otherend.   Joshua Slocum, another Nova Scotian, became the first amateur tosail alone around the world at the turn of the century but, with anold alarm clock as his navigational timepiece, he was not intent onspeed. Indeed, he would freeload for months at a time en route athospitable yacht clubs.   With transoceanic jets leaving few worlds to conquer, however,yachtsmen increasingly looked to old records to test their mettle.Sir Francis Chichester circled the globe with Gypsy Moth IV in 1966at age 66 in 226 days with only one stop. Three years later anotherEnglishman, Robin Knox-Johnston, who a psychiatrist said was``distressingly normal'' before and afterward, won a race around theworld in 313 days to become the first non-stop, solocircumnavigator. Another contestant, a Frenchman named BernardMoitessier, was winning on the home stretch. He decided, however, hepreferred his own solitary company at sea to that of his fellowhumans ashore and sailed on for another half of the globe, finallystopping in Tahiti.   Since then, racing across large bodies of ocean alone or withcrew has become commonplace. It has become particularly appealing toFrenchmen who excel at sailing high-speed multihull sailboats vastdistances with occasional interruptions when the technology fallsapart and sinks.   Luhrs, a Rhode Islander, is also a transoceanic soloist as isDodge Morgan, a former journalist turned manufacturer, now living inMaine after setting a non-stop record around the globe of 150 days.   If Luhrs' record stands for another 135 years, it won't be forlack of challengers. Even as he finished under the Golden GateBridge, two French persons, Phillipe Monnet who left New York Jan.8, and Anne Liardet, a 27-year-old sailing with her fiance, hadalready rounded the Horn. Monnet reportedly hit an iceberg; Liardetwas ahead of Flying Cloud's time but behind Luhrs'.   Luhrs said on arrival in San Francisco ``once is enough.'' Thisleaves Eleanor Creesy with some consolation. She is the onlynavigator to have guided her husband around the Horn to a record _twice.	</TEXT><NOTE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The forces that fought the free-trade agreementwith the United States say they have no intention of giving up onthe issue despite their election loss to Prime Minister BrianMulroney.   ``There is a continuing trade agenda before us,'' Tony Clark,director of the Pro-Canada Network, said in an interview. ``I thinkit boils down to how much more political and economic depending canCanada take on the greatest economic power in the world.''   The coalition of some 20 national organizations, including churchgroups, environmentalists and women's groups, was formed in 1987 tobattle the trade agreement.   Its publicity, especially a comic book outlining the tradeissues, was among the most visible during the campaign that endedNov. 21 with a majority government for Mulroney's ProgressiveConservative Party.   That cleared the way for the trade agreement he signed in January1988 with U.S. President Ronald Reagan to proceed, but the opponentsplan to keep dramatizing the changes they believe it will force onCanada.   Clarke said the activist groups that form the anti-free tradecoalition met again after the election and pledged to continue ``forwhat we call the long haul'' of at least the next four or five years.   ``There was credible commitment and resolve to continue,'' hesaid.   The greatest concern during the campaign focused on the impactthat the trade agreement could have on Canada's more extensivenetwork of health and social programs.   The anti-free traders plan to put the spotlight on any incidentsin which they believe the government backs away from its pledge thatprograms won't be affected.   Also getting attention will be any workers who lose their jobs asa result of the trade agreement.   The supporters of free trade forecast a net increase of as manyas 250,000 jobs over 10 years, but concede that some plants will beclosing as business and industry restructures to serve a wider NorthAmerican market.   Many of the questions about what constitutes government subsidiesremain to be decided in U.S.-Canadian negotiations over the nextseveral years.   ``The battle is not over,'' Mel Hurtig, publisher of ``TheCanadian Encyclopedia'' and a vocal opponent of the agreement, saidin a phone interview from Edmonton, Alberta. ``We consider thatwe're bloodied and bruised, but we've only lost one major battle inthe war.''   The majority government that Mulroney won means there won't beanother election for about four years, but anti-free traders predictthat the issue once again will be the dominant one in the nextcampaign.	</TEXT><NOTE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Painfully slowly at times, a strong sense ofnational pride and identity seems to be emerging in Canada.   Canadian native Kate Nelligan recently appeared on stage here enroute to a bravura performance on Broadway in ``Spoils of War.''   The actress was making her first professional appearance inCanada after triumphs elsewhere, but she professed surprise thatanyone would find that quirky fact about her career interesting orrelevant.   When a new owner purchased the Toronto Argonauts of the ailingCanadian Football League, the local speculation was rampant that hewas interested not in the club but in the lease for the city'sspectacular new Skydome to bring in a National Football Leaguefranchise.   The sale terms finally were produced to show that he would nothave any such rights to the stadium even if the Argonauts folded.   Canada, the world's second largest country, has its complexes.   When Prime Minister Brian Mulroney emerged in his hometown ofBaie-Comeau, Quebec, for a resounding victory celebration after theNov. 21 election, he spoke of a new Canada that was proud of itsabilities and ready to compete internationally.   By contrast, this is what Canadian media expert Marshall McLuhan,who died in 1980, wrote to then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in1968:   ``Canada is the only country in the world that has never had anational identity. In an age when all homogeneous nations are losingtheir identity images through rapid technological change, Canadaalone can `keep its cool.''' The campaign was fought over suchissues of national identity and purpose, summed up in the questionof whether Canada should go ahead with the free-trade agreement withthe United States signed by Mulroney and President Reagan in January1988.   The election outcome with a second consecutive majoritygovernment for Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party cleared theway for the trade agreement.   The election brought Canada an unusual amount of attentioninternationally, something of a surprise to most Canadians whoroutinely say their country is of only limited interest to theworld. It also served domestically as a rare episode of intensivedebate and soul-searching.   Perhaps the greatest surprise was the pride both camps felt inCanada.   For Mulroney and the pro-free traders, Canada was a land ofcompetence and hard work, ready to take on competitors in the UnitedStates without the protection of tariffs despite being outnumberednearly 10 to one.   For anti-free traders, Canada was a caring country and unbridledmarket forces _ seen here as being American _ could threaten itstraditions of generosity and protection for its people.   No line brought greater applause to Liberal Party leader JohnTurner, who ran a fervent campaign against the free trade agreement,than when he roared: ``When you walk into a Canadian hospital, theydon't check your credit card before they check your pulse.''   A certain smugness could be noted in Canadians running down theirlist of concerns about too much contact with the United States, fromthe cleanliness of Canadian cities and lower crime rates to theirbelief that government exists to take care of and provide servicesfor its citizens.   The ``L'' word for liberal that is buried so often in U.S.politics is nothing to be feared in Canada. Indeed, the comparableword game played here is to point out that the emphasis inProgressive Conservative Party should be on progressive.   Although free trade overwhelmed all other issues this fall, oneof the major controversies expected in the coming months is aboutthe government's role in providing child day-care.   Writer and popular historian Pierre Berton believes geography andhistory have created a firm identity in Canada and too much has beenmade of a national inferiority complex.	</TEXT><NOTE>By SONNI EFRON</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>FREETOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The ritual slayings of 15 people by adrug-smuggling ring in northern Mexico underscore the need forpolice to be trained to recognize the signs of all kinds of occultcrime, according to a growing group of ``cult cops.''   While the Matamoros slayings apparently had nothing to do withdevil worship, satanism has become a hot topic in law enforcementcircles.   Law enforcement officials nationwide note an increase in reportsof satanic grafitti, animal mutilations and signs that occultrituals have taken place. But some say the threat is beingexaggerated.   Nonetheless, a seminar on satanism and crime sponsored by theConnecticut State Police last month attracted more than 300 policeofficers from all over New England who wanted to learn how todistinguish serious satanists from teen-age pranksters and how torespond to each.   Sober law enforcement journals are running articles describing a``satanic threat'' and telling police how to spot evidence at crimescenes that might be overlooked by those unfamiliar with cultpractices.   Among the new breed of cult cops, sometimes derided as``ghostbusters'' by their colleagues, is Detective Sgt. Alan L.Alves of Freetown. Alves has never made an arrest for a sataniccrime and has found no evidence of human sacrifices. But he'sconvinced such ritual murders are occurring.   ``The organized satanists leave absolutely no evidence,'' Alvessays. ``They're killing. That's what they believe in. They have tomake sacrifices. They're killing babies.''   The Matamoros killings were not related to satanism, accordingto Thomas Wedge, a former Union, Ohio, deputy sheriff and theauthor of ``The Satan Hunter.'' Wedge makes his living lecturingabout satanism, mainly to law enforcement groups.   Wedge, reached in Baton Rouge, La., where he was conducting aseminar for the state police, said the Matamoros killers werepracticing a black magic version of brujeria, an Afro-Caribbeanreligion.   ``This is not an isolated case by any means,'' he said, addingthat he knows of at least one other ritual killing by drug dealers.   Wedge said brujeria is practiced by many Cuban criminals whocame to the United States on the Mariel boat lift.   Other experts dispute Wedge's contention that brujeria was toblame.   Among them is Robert D. Hicks, a criminal justice analyst forthe state of Virginia, and a former police officer in Tucson,Ariz., where he had firsthand experience with drug smugglers andbrujeria, which gets its name from the Spanish word for witch _brujo.   Brujo, who are found in the Caribbean, Mexico and in Hispaniccommunities all over the United States, are witch doctors or wisemen who may also practice some magic, Hicks says, but the vastmajority are peaceful and law-abiding.   Hicks says the Matamoros killers may have drawn on elements ofthe religion to promise their followers magical immunity tobullets. Or, the cult leaders, including Alfonso de JesusConstanzo, a Cuban-American, may have just had an appetite forblood and wanted to terrorize competitors and police.   ``In northern Mexico, drug trafficking is intenselycompetitive,'' Hicks says. ``Nobody knows at the moment ifConstanzo actually has some deep, abiding faith that pushed him tocommit these crimes, or if he was just a slick operator who made itup as he went along.''   Hicks, who is writing a book critical of the ``satanism scare''in law enforcement circles, says the real danger is that police maybegin trampling on the religious freedoms of those who practicenon-Christian beliefs, even though there is no evidence ofcriminality.   The FBI's chief expert on cult crime, Kenneth V. Lanning, andother law enforcement officials contacted around the country saidthere is no solid evidence that crimes committed by satanworshipers are on the increase in America.   ``I question whether there is a true increase,'' says Lanning,supervisory special agent at the FBI's behavioral sciences unit inQuantico, Va., who is frequently contacted by local officialsseeking help on cases with cult overtones.   But Wedge insists satanists have been thriving on policeignorance and disbelief.   ``It doesn't really matter what you or I believe,'' Wedge says.``It's what they believe that's dangerous.''   Connecticut state police have noticed an increase in the numberof phone callers reporting satanic activity, particularly aroundHalloween.   ``We've only had incidents of things that could be classified asa bona fide satanic ritual, and those things did not involve anycriminal acts except minor things like criminal trespass or illegalbonfires,'' says Sgt. Scott O'Mara.	</TEXT><NOTE>By STEVE FEICA</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WATERBURY, Conn.

Does the lack of alcohol mean a dull crowd? Not according toClub Soda's two managers.   ``It's like `Is there life without drinking?' Yeah, there sureis,'' Rowlay says. ``The important thing is people who don't drinkare no different from people that do, I mean in terms of dullness.Because you have some people who don't drink who are dull and youhave some people who do drink who are dull.''   The Club Soda drink menu runs the gamut from the ever-popularShirley Temple, ginger ale with a dash of grenadine, to more exoticitems such as the Lemon Spritzer, Pineburst and a host of frozencoladas, as well a mineral water, cappucino and expresso coffees.   Joe Mrozinski, head bartender at Club Soda, says the fancydrinks, at $3.50 a pop, are big sellers. ``There's not much callfor non-alcoholic beer so we discontinued it.'' he said.   ``The help has been very supportive of this and it's tough tofind bartenders that will work without getting the tips thatthey're accustomed to in a real bar,'' Perugini says.   The club, which opened Feb. 27, averages 130 to 150 people anight, Perugini says.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hollywood of late has been preoccupied withreliving the Vietnam war, but at least one of the central playersin that controversial conflict says he hasn't been the least bitinterested in reviewing any celluloid versions of those turbulenttimes.   ``I was there,'' says Nguyen Cao Ky. ``I know what happened.''   Ky, who was prime minister of South Vietnam in the mid-1960s,made this observation recently in an interview at his seafoodpacking plant next to the dark, sluggish waters of Bayou Caillou.   It is in this remote little Cajun community, he says, that hehopes to end an exile odyssey which began nearly 35 years ago, whenhe and 1 million of his countrymen fled south following France'sdefeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954.   ``I grew up in North Vietnam, near Hanoi,'' he said. ``When Iwas 20 I was recruited by the French colonial government to fightthe communist insurgents. I began my military career in 1949 as aninfantry officer in North Vietnam and later received flighttraining in Algeria and Paris.''   Ky's flight to Saigon in 1954 marked the first stop of theodyssey. Two decades later, after losing again to the communists,Ky went into exile for the second time, this time in the UnitedStates.   Now, he says, he hardly ever thinks about those days, when HoChi Minh City was still called Saigon and he was the supremecommander of South Vietnam.   ``I am a Confucian,'' he adds, by way of explanation. ``Webelieve there are times of joy and times of sadness; what will be,will be. But it's true that I did have absolute power when I wasmade premier, after Ngo Dinh Diem was forced out in 1965. You mayrecall there was no congressional body in South Vietnam at thattime. For more than two years, my word was the absolute law.''   At that time Ky _ who still is slim and young-looking at 59 _was a dashing young fighter pilot. He favored flashy flight suits,carried a pair of pearl-handled pistols and frequently appeared,thus garbed, in U.S. news magazine photo layouts.   In fact, Ky and his wife, then a glamorous airline hostess whowas fond of cowgirl outfits, often were depicted as a ``funcouple'' who were representing our side in an unpleasant little,U.S.-backed adventure that would contain communism in SoutheastAsia. History proved otherwise, of course, and Ky's governmentsince has been given mixed reviews, as has the U.S. involvement inVietnam.   Asked about reports of civil rights abuses during his time aspremier, Ky smiles sadly. But the smile quickly disappears when heis asked about rumors he stashed millions of dollars worth of goldand jewels during his tenure as premier.   ``My wife and I had only about $30,000 when we came to thiscountry in 1975,'' he says. ``And when I left South Vietnam, on theday Saigon fell, I took nothing with me except my uniform and thehelicopter which I flew to a U.S. warship. I had managed to get mywife and family on a flight out just two days earlier, while NguyenVan Thieu, who had succeeded me as premier in 1967, fled with hisfamily weeks before Saigon fell.''   He adds, ``That is why I am the only South Vietnamese leadertoday who is able to go freely among our people in exile. They knowI was a patriot who fought to the last.''   Author Neil Sheehan, whose book on the Vietnam war, ``A BrightShining Lie,'' recently won the Pulitzer Prize, remembers Ky andThieu as ``corrupt Young Turks'' who rose to power in South Vietnamas U.S involvement dramatically increased. Ky flatly denies thecharacterization.   ``I have a clear conscience,'' he says. ``It's true I had power,but I'm proud to be able to say that it did not corrupt me. If Ihad stolen millions of dollars I could live like a king in thiscountry, but obviously I don't live like a king. Believe me, I wasa soldier fighting for freedom, not a politician interested inpower and money.''   Former Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who commanded the U.S.forces in Vietnam throughout most of the `60s, says he remembers Kyas an honest soldier who was revered by his pilots and officers inthe South Vietnamese Air Force.	</TEXT><NOTE>By SUE MAJOR HOLMES</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>GALLUP, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's a roster of the stars of yesteryear,with names like Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne, MariaMontez, Tom Mix, Virginia Mayo, Ronald Reagan, Lucille Ball.   The names adorn the doors of guest rooms throughout the ElRancho Hotel, which owes its birth to Hollywood.   The hotel was built in 1937 by the brother of movie magnate D.W.Griffith to house the actors and actresses who were then flockingto the wide-open spaces and red bluffs of northwestern New Mexicoto make movies, mostly Westerns.   On famed Route 66, the hotel played host to the famous, thenear-famous and the once-famous for decades. But as Westerns faded,so did El Rancho.   It went through a series of owners, finally ending up on theauction block in a bankruptcy foreclosure 50 years after its grandopening.   Gallup businessman Armand Ortega bought the one-time showplacefor $500,000 and spent about another $500,000 restoring it, sayshis daughter, Amelia Ortega Crowther, manager-bookkeeper for ElRancho.   The hotel _ which looks a bit like an oversized ranch house _reopened in May 1988, its original motto of ``Charm of Yesterday,Convenience of Tomorrow'' intact in neon above the entrance.   The hotel's huge, brick-floored, two-story lobby was restored toits Western flavor, a lariat surrounding the mirror behind thecheck-in counter, silver dollars embedded in the counter itself.   The lobby's centerpiece is a huge arched rock and brickfireplace into which the original mason cut a cardplayer's diamond,club, spade and heart _ appropriate since there once was opengambling at the big hotel.   Near the lobby, on a wooden bench and a chair made of steerhorns, sit wooden Indians. The lobby walls and railings arefestooned with big game trophies, Navajo rugs and Indian andWestern art.   A rustic, curving double staircase, the carpeted steps made oflogs sawed in half, flows gracefully up either side of thefireplace to a wide balcony that encircles the main room.   The walls of the balcony are lined with black-and-whitephotographs. There are scenes from movies filmed in the area suchas ``Texas Ranger,'' starring Fred MacMurray, Jean Parker and LloydNolan; ``Ambush,'' with Robert Taylor; ``The Streets of Laredo,''starring William Holden and William Bendix; ``Rocky Mountain,''with Errol Flynn; ``Colorado Territory,'' with Joel McCrea;``Pursued,'' starring Robert Mitchum.   There are photographs _ dozens of them _ of stars such as theMarx Brothers, Alan Ladd, Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn, KirkDouglas, Lew Ayres, John Russell of the television show ``TheLawman,'' Robert Taylor and the Fondas, Henry and Jane, across thebalcony from each other.   Some photographs are autographed, often to Martin Hanks, thehotel's first manager.   At one end of the balcony is a picture of Clair Gurley. Asalesman, he was the first person to stay at El Rancho when itopened in 1937. Ms. Crowther says that when Ortega reopened thehotel in 1988, he invited Gurley back _ and charged him theoriginal $5-a-night price.   Today's rates range from $32 to $49.   The three-story hotel, still serviced by its originalhand-cranked elevator, has 70 rooms. Each room is labeled with thename of a star who, research shows, probably stayed in that veryroom, Ms. Crowther says.   However, there's at least one exception.   Ronald Reagan stayed at El Rancho a couple of times while makinga movie and filming ``Death Valley Days'' for television, but Ms.Crowther says today's Ronald Reagan room is one that probably isn'tlabeled accurately.   El Rancho originally had a hierarchy of rooms, the best ones inan area by themselves. One of the best is now the Reagan room, butthat probably has more to do with him being president than being astar.   ``I'd guess Ronald Reagan never stayed in the Ronald Reagan roombecause he wasn't an `A' star,'' Ms. Crowther says. ``He was aB-movie star.''   The hotel keeps jelly beans, Reagan's favorite snack, in theroom. And if someone orders the Ronald Reagan sandwich from thedining room, that, too, comes with jelly beans.   There are rooms with the names of Jimmy Stewart, Robert Taylor,Groucho Marx, W.C. Fields, Doris Day, Jack Benny.   Ortega, Ms. Crowther says, once joked about ordering a pay phonefor the Jack Benny room, in keeping with the running gag about thestar's stinginess.   Ms. Crowther says guests often ask for a room named for aparticular star.   The choices also include the names of Lee Marvin, Lee Remick,Claude Akins, Betty Grable, Rosalind Russell, Burt Lancaster,Elizabeth Scott, William Holden, Irene Manning.   Ms. Crowther admits she doesn't know who all the stars are _Irene Manning, for instance.   The rooms have been refurbished to close-to-original state, Ms.Crowther says. One of El Rancho's previous owners had paneled them,but Ortega had the paneling ripped out and the walls replasteredwhite.   He also had the rooms furnished with rustic-looking furniture,such as beds with wagon-wheel headboards.   Several rooms have the original furniture, the light oak oiledafter being rescued from under a thick coating of chocolate brownpaint.   All the rooms have ceiling fans, since air-conditioning was notput in when the hotel was originally built half a century ago.   It does have air-conditioning now, so guests no longer must goout onto the roof to get a breath of cool air as they did in theold days.   Among the photographs displayed on the second-floor balcony isone showing Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, stars of ``The Seaof Grass,'' sitting on El Rancho's roof with the movie's director,who is not identified.   The guest rooms now have tiny bathrooms, added in an earlyrenovation. Except for rooms for big stars, the original hotel didnot have bathrooms in each room, but rather had ``baths down thehall,'' Ms. Crowther says.   Since its reopening, El Rancho mostly has played host toordinary folk. But there have been a couple of stars.   Michael Gross of television's ``Family Ties'' ate at the hotel'sdining room one day.

About 8,000 workers once toiled at the plant, turning limestone,iron ore and coal into America's pipe, wire and tin plate. Onlyabout 900 workers remain in two small mills that have managed toprove their profitability in the fickle 1980s.   But Vallecorsa, president of United Steelworkers Local 1211,won't fight for the old plant.   ``Why raise people's hopes? As long as the mill is standingthere, rotting away, there's a false sense of hope it is going tostart again,'' he says.   Along the 80-mile-long steel valley of the Ohio and Monongahelarivers, closed plants are being demolished in preparation for theirmetamorphosis as industrial parks, high-tech centers and evenamusement parks.   From Chicago to Buffalo, large manufacturing plants areundergoing similar transformations.   ``It's like the greening of the valley,'' says Steve Barrouk,director of the Allegheny County Industrial Development Authority.``We're changing from gray to green essentially. We're looking atopen space, clean, light industrial development and some heavieractivity.''   From 1979 to 1987 more than 67,000 jobs in basic steel and 63,000jobs in heavy manufacturing were lost in the Pittsburgh area.Companies closed within days, sometimes overnight, leaving behindeerie, ghost town-like plants where coats still hung on hooks andlunch boxes waited to be opened.   While social service agencies tried to help the displacedworkers, planners turned their attention to the shuttered plantsthemselves.   In particular, they looked at mills in the Monongahela Valleysouth of Pittsburgh, the cradle of America's steel industry. Forpsychological and economic reasons, they believed the change had tobegin there or the valley, so dependent on steel for so manydecades, would wither.   ``Around the end of the '70s and the early '80s, we wereexperiencing a major shutdown every week,'' Barrouk says. ``Themagnitude was such that it was almost impossible to respond in anyway you thought was adequate.   ``There were a lot of major facilities in private, corporatehands, and the companies were not interested in being landlords.''   Public and private entrepreneurs with a vision stepped in.Although there's no general, long-term plan for the region, a quietrenaissance in real estate has emerged. Some examples:   _Just six miles from downtown Pittsburgh, USX Corp.'s century-oldHomestead Works is being turned into a new alloy of lightmanufacturing plants, offices and a riverfront playground with waterslides, a boardwalk and a sandy beach.   _Within five minutes of downtown Pittsburgh, the former J&amp;L SteelCorp.'s Hazelwood plant is becoming the city's version ofCalifornia's Silicon Valley. Bulldozers have cleared the way for thePittsburgh Technology Center, a site for developing robots, computerprograms and research into biotechnology.   _In Glassport, about 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, the formerCopperweld Corp. wire manufacturing plant is the home of 14companies producing windows, ball bearings, steel rods andfuturistic airbuses.   _In neighboring McKeesport and Duquesne, USX Corp. last yearturned its National and Duquesne works over to Barrouk's agency inwhat is believed to be the nation's largest transfer of industrialproperty to local governmental agencies for redevelopment.   At an international conference on urban renewal, a team ofexperts led by Britain's Prince Charles descended upon the valleylast year to examine ways to revitalize the area. In general, theirideas validated what some private and public developers already hadplanned or begun.   Not everyone has been receptive.   Those who believe basic steel can bounce back say demolishingplants such as Homestead is akin to hammering the last nail in thecoffin of the nation's old-fashioned, integrated mills and thecommunities that became dependent on them.   ``In many cases, these facilities were horrendously managed,''says Bob Erickson of the Steel Valley Authority, which is trying tomaintain steelmaking in the Mon Valley.   With leaner, smaller operations that can respond more quickly tochanges in the market, some doomed plants still could be producingsteel profitably, Erickson says. In some cases, steel is even beingmanufactured on a limited scale at plants that are being demolished,such as Aliquippa.   Others, however, point to study after study that have determinedthat steelmaking at many of the facilities is no longer feasible.The future for the sites, they say, is to offer a more diverse mixof goods and services.   ``We're going to get jobs back,'' Barrouk says. ``But instead ofone manufacturer that has a club of influence on a community, we'retalking about dozens of manufacturers.''   Erickson questions whether such sites are truly marketable.   ``They're unattractive,'' he says. ``They have high taxes, pooraccess, bad public service and bad school systems. The locationsaren't conducive to light industry or high technology without a lotof work being done.''   Kelly Park, whose company is developing the Homestead Works,acknowledges it will take millions of dollars to clean the sites ofpollutants and build roads, bridges and sewer and water lines. Buthe says once the stage is set, there will be plenty of interestedactors.	</TEXT><NOTE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When petite Gail Mazzetti Hooks spotted twothugs beating a Houston police officer and going for his gun, sheattacked with uncharacteristic fury _ scratching, kicking andpunching _ until the two men fled.   ``I thought they were going to kill him,'' recalls Hooks, awaitress who had been watching the events from inside a restaurant.``He had the prettiest face, but he was purple. I kept thinking,`That could be my brother.'''   Hooks ran after one of the bad guys until reality caught up withheroism on that warm, humid evening of April 20, 1986. In a backalley, alone and shaking, she abandoned the chase, threw up in thebushes, and hurried home to bed.   Nevertheless, the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission proclaimed her ahero, and a forever-grateful officer James Whitley sent flowers.   Hooks is one of 7,313 men, women and children who have beenhonored by the commission since its founding in 1904 byindustrialist Andrew Carnegie, who was moved by the braverydisplayed following a mine explosion near Pittsburgh.   Carnegie heroes receive $2,500 and a bronze medal on which isinscribed the New Testament verse: ``Greater love hath no man thanthis, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''   For the self-effacing Hooks, who moved out of Texas shortlyafter the fracas because one of the attackers remained at large,the term ``hero'' is one she is uncomfortable with.   ``That was the way I was brought up,'' said Hooks, now 31 andliving in Charlotte, N.C. ``If you saw someone who needed help, youjust helped them. You don't think about it, you just do it.''   To Whitley, however, Hooks and another waitress who came to hisrescue deserve the title.   ``I couldn't believe they tried to help me like that when theycould have easily gotten killed or hurt,'' recalls Whitley, 28, whois still on the Houston police force.   ``I probably wouldn't be here today if not for them.''   In establishing the fund, which he endowed with $5 million,Carnegie said he wasn't trying to ``create heroism...knowing wellthat heroic action is impulsive.''   He also said he wanted to make sure heroes or their survivorsdon't ``suffer pecuniarily'' as a result of their deeds.   Paying for pensions, scholarship money and funeral expenses ``iswhere Carnegie has its real punch,'' says commission spokesmanWalter Rutkowski.   In 85 years, more than 63,000 people have been nominated forheroism awards. Only 7,313, or about 11 percent, were chosen toreceive them.   ``We are up to our whatever in nominees,'' says Rutkowski, whoseoffice in downtown Pittsburgh is watched over by a somber portraitof Carnegie. ``We give away as many awards as we have cases thatmeet our requirements.''   Nominees are scrutinized by three investigators before they arevoted on by the commission's 21-member executive committee.   Like ``Dragnet's'' Joe Friday, investigators want to know ``justthe facts.''   `In a drowning case, we go for the water temperature, thedistance of the swim, the current and the rescuer's swimmingability,'' Rutkowski says. ``We don't get into a person's psyche.   ``You can not get emotionally tied up with these cases. You justdon't have the capacity to see these cases other than clinically.It's like a doctor in the operating room. You don't want him toweep over the pain you're in.''   Candidates are excluded from consideration if they are obligatedto act because of their occupation, such as lifeguard orfirefighter. A person who saves a family member also is excluded,unless the rescuer is severely injured or killed.   Above all, the victim must be in imminent danger of losing hislife, and the hero must risk his life in performing the rescue,which must take place in the United States or Canada.   More than 1,500 Carnegie heroes, or roughly 21 percent, diedperforming their rescues, the most common of which involvedrownings or fires.	</TEXT><NOTE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><TEXT>   Donna Castle's fourth-graders in Milford, Pa., have adopted aninjured red-tailed hawk named the Red Baroness. Nine-year-oldStephen Raba thinks of the hawk as his own.   ``He talks about it all the time, about his bird. He takes itpersonally,'' says his mother, Lynne Raba. ``When some of the classwent to see it, he was adamant that he had to go, that it was soimportant. It's something that he takes a lot of pride in.''   The students at Dingman Delaware Elementary School recycled $25worth of aluminum cans to adopt the bird for one month at a nearbyrehabiltation center for injured and orphaned birds of prey. Thechildren are hoping they can keep the Red Baroness on the mend untilshe's ready to be released into the wild.   Elsewhere, financial foster parents are being sought for amanatee in Florida, baby puffins off the coast of Maine andCalifornia gray whales in the Pacific Ocean. A Pennsylvania troutstream can be adopted for an investment of labor, as can a Texasbeach and an Arkansas highway.   Across the nation, environmental groups are offering ``adoption''plans for wild birds and animals, their habitats, and open spaces asa way to raise money anywhere nature is in trouble. The groups saymore and more people are adopting the wild through contributions.   ``It's hands-on. It's strong and it's powerful,'' says Pat Noonanof the Conservation Fund in Washington, D.C.   ``The environmental movement is trying to reach out in creativeways to enlist volunteer support and involvement, and adopt-a-treeand adopt-a-whale are things people can identify with.''   Jennifer Bates of the Whale Center in Oakland, Calif., one ofseveral organizations offering whales for adoption, says, ``It's agimmick, a hook, because everybody is hurting, everybody needsmoney. After you donate to a couple organizations, chances are yourmailbox is going to be inundated, so you want to be the one piece ofmail folks will not throw out.''   Zoos and aviaries often sponsor adoption programs for bothspecial projects and general upkeep, says Charles Wickenhauser ofthe Pittsburgh Zoo, which recently raised $6,500 to build a newpenguin exhibit through a ``penguin parents'' program.   ``I think the generation of baby boomers has less of a givingtradition than our parents did,'' he says. ``We're trying to findthe trigger for their giving and trying to find it innon-traditional ways, what unlocks the purse.''   Adoption rates range from $10 to hundreds of dollars. The moneyis used either directly _ to buy housing, medical care and food forthe adoptee _ or indirectly, to subsidize research, speciespreservation, educational programs or lobby efforts.   In exchange, foster parents usually receive a glossy photographand description of their animal, occasional updates about itscomings and goings and, just like Cabbage Patch dolls, a certificateof adoption.   But adoptions don't work for all environmental causes.   ``You have to have something that's there and identifiable, thatyou can photograph and put a name on,'' says Craig Van Note ofMonitor Consortium of Conservation and Animal Welfare Organizationsin Washington D.C.   ``There's no way you can really adopt an elephant in Africa. In acase like that, you'd have to tell the people their elephant gotkilled last week, and that would be a downer.''   A Florida native, Debra Brown, 33, of Orlando, was accustomed toseeing manatees swimming in the state's shallow rivers.   But it wasn't until she received an appeal to adopt ``Boomer''that she became passionately involved in saving the gentle andfragile animals, most of whom bear scars from boat propellers.   ``If something happened to Boomer, you'd probably find me intears,'' she says. ``As big and, quote, ugly as manatees are,they're beautiful.''   Since the Save The Manatee Club of Maitland, Fla., began offeringadoptions in 1984, officials say membership has grown from 800 to20,000 adults and about 60,000 students _ 80,000 foster parents inall trying to save a species whose population has dwindled to about1,200.	</TEXT><NOTE>By THOMAS MURPHY</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Backstage at the American ConservatoryTheater, August Wilson takes a pull on a cigarette and ponders thedifferences between regional theater and Broadway.   ``One is about the work, and the other is about money,'' says thePulitzer Prize-winning playwright. ``Broadway and Broadway producerscould care less about the work, about the content of the work.''   ``Their concern is `How are we going to get people into thetheater to see whatever it is?' It could be the worst thingimaginable...That's the way the producers think.''   He allows that there are some ``happy coincidences'' when qualityand profit overlap.   Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play ``Fences'' enjoyed asuccessful Broadway run and won a New York Drama Critics CircleAward and a Tony.   He won another Critics Circle award for ``Ma Rainey's BlackBottom,'' which ran for six months but didn't make a profit. A thirdBroadway show, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' closed at a lossafter a brief run.   Those three plays are part of a cycle of 10 works Wilson iswriting about the black experience during each decade of the 20thcentury. It was ACT's production of ``Joe Turner'' that broughtWilson to San Francisco, and he liked what he saw in a cast led byRoscoe Lee Browne.   Wilson is in the enviable position of having many offers frommany quarters.   He has just completed the first draft of his play about the1960s, tentatively titled ``Two Trains Running,'' and is working onthe screenplay for ``Fences.'' He also has plans for some shortstories, a mystery novel, more poetry and a performance piece called``Seven Guitars'' that he says will diverge from his moretraditionally structured plays.   All this work flows from a man who grew up on the poor side oftown, dropped out of school in ninth grade, worked at odd jobs andgot started as a writer by jotting down lines in restaurants andbars.   But it is that background that makes Wilson what he is: a keenobserver of the sweat, grit, pain and injustice that marks life inAmerica's underclass.   Although his father ``had a presence in the household,'' Wilsonwas raised by his mother in Pittsburgh's Hill District, a meltingpot of Jews and Syrians, blacks and whites where he shared two roomswith three sisters and two brothers.   His first poems were written anonymously in the seventh grade toa pretty classmate named Nancy Ireland.   ``I would write these poems and leave them on her desk,'' hesays. That lasted until Nancy took up with a boy named Anthony. ``Ialways figured that she thought Anthony was the one writing thepoems.''   Nancy's loss was the world's gain as Wilson continued to writepoetry. Some were published in anthologies, and the author found he``could always pick up a few dollars reading some poems here andthere.''   But mostly he worked odd jobs. Terrible jobs. For some terriblebosses.   ``One time I was an elevator. I was not an elevator operator. Iwas the elevator. A men's clothing store was on the third floor andmy job consisted of running from the first floor to the third floorwhen anyone came in (to pick something up). They had three tailorsup there, so they stayed pretty busy.   ``I didn't mind because I would read until someone came in.''   In 1968, as black Americans were debating the character of theirculture and looking for ways to change their role in society, Wilsonfelt a need to contribute as an artist and, with a friend, foundedthe Black Horizon Theater. He knew nothing of theater at the time.``So the first thing I did was to go to the library and find a bookon how to direct a play.   ``Since we had a theater, I ran right home and said `Let me writea play.' Well, I sat down and wrote a play and the characters didnot talk. And I said, `Well, this playwriting business is not forme.'''   He wrote a few one-act plays, then went back to poetry.   To this day, he says he's familiar with only one play byShakespeare and one by Chekhov. He has never seen a play by HenrikIbsen, David Mamet or Sam Shepard. ``I've never read `Raisin In TheSun,' either. I saw the movie.''   The foundation of Wilson's writing, he says, is the blues.   ``The reason I'm able to do what I do is because all the ideasand characters come out of the blues. I listen to the music, which Isee as a cultural response of an entire people to the world thatthey find themselves in.''   In 1978, Wilson moved to St. Paul, Minn., and got a job writingscripts for its science museum. An actress from the museum invitedhim to see a play, and Wilson came away thinking he could do itbetter. That gave birth to ``Jitneys,'' a play about gypsy cabdrivers in Pittsburgh.   ``That was the first realistic play I wrote.''   It was also the start of Wilson's 20th century cycle.   ``Jitneys'' was set in 1971. ``Fullerton Street,'' set in 1941,followed ``because I wanted to write about the clash of the ruralSouth and the urban North.''   ``After that, I wrote `Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,' which was setin 1927. And I felt, why don't I just continue to do this. And then`Fences' was the '50s.''   ``Joe Turner'' was set in 1911. ``Piano Lesson'' takes place in1936.   His intent in ``Two Trains Running,'' which takes place in the1960s, is to show the relationship of blacks to the rest of Americansociety.   ``Once I had that as my focus, I discovered the relationship wasnot very much unlike that of a slave community back during slavery.Although there is freedom and the Emancipation Proclamation, a lotof the relationships still exist. And so I thought I could show thatrelationship and the real problem.   ``The real problem in America is the labor problem. That's whyblacks were brought to America from Africa, as a labor system. Whichis ironic. At one time, all blacks were working. And now nobody'sworking.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 14 newly pinned college fraternitypledges, roused by the members' speeches and their own desire tobelong, were led downstairs into the darkened Lambda Chi Alphabasement and lined up in front of the bar.   On went the lights, revealing the final stage of the pinningnight. There sat 200 ``kamikazes,'' a potent vodka concoction.   They drank.   James Callahan of North Bergen drank until he dropped dead.   The 18-year-old's alcohol death last winter at Rutgers Universitywas one of a string of scandals at fraternity houses around thecountry that have brought more pressure for reforms of theGreek-letter brotherhoods.   With their futures at stake, fraternities are responding.   Bars in many fraternity houses are being closed and advisers arereturning. And the National Interfraternity Conference isconsidering a total ban on pledging.   ``It's not easy to change the culture, but until we do I thinkthere are going to be very bad days ahead for fraternities,'' saysJohn Creedon, a Rutgers assistant provost. Since Callahan's death,Creedon has led the push for fraternity reforms at Rutgers.   ``Fraternities are under fire as never before,'' says EileenStevens, a national anti-hazing activist. Mrs. Stevens has traveledthe country since her son died 10 years ago after drinking too muchduring a hazing at Alfred University in upstate New York.   ``Their very future is in jeopardy,'' Mrs. Stevens says. ``Ithink we've come to a point where the people who supervise themrealize the problems are enormous, and they're just not sure what todo about it.''   The problems boil down to two hard-dying traditions _ drinkingand hazing.   Critics call fraternities an anachronism.   ``Fraternities have been engaged, like the brontosaurus, in afutile struggle against a changed climate,'' Earl Smith, dean atColby College, wrote last year in the Chronicle of Higher Education.Fraternities have been banned at Colby since 1984, whenadministrators decided they no longer fit in at the college inWaterville, Maine.   Fraternity leaders say the scandals are relatively few, thatelitism charges are unfounded and that the positives such asfriendship, leadership development and community service faroutweigh any negatives.   But over the past two years, defenders of the fraternity systemhave winced at a series of incidents. In addition to the Rutgersdeath:   _our members of the University of Alabama chapter of Sigma AlphaEpsilon, the largest national fraternity, were arrested on chargesof selling cocaine. They were accused of making some of the drugdeals out of the stately chapter house.   _At the University of Lowell in Massachusetts, six fraternitymembers were charged under the state's tough anti-hazing law over astunt that sent a pledge to the hospital with a body temperature of109. The members had bundled the victim in a sleeping bag and turnedon heaters nearby.   _A former University of Delaware student claimed in a lawsuitthat someone dumped caustic oven cleaner over his head during afraternity ``Hell Night.''   But nothing stirred an outcry like Callahan's death at Rutgers.It inspired nearly a dozen bills in the New Jersey Legislature andis cited by fraternity critics nationally.   ``That probably had more impact on us than any other hazingincident,'' says Jonathan Brant, director of the NationalInterfraternity Conference.   The reprisals against Lambda Chi Alpha were swift and harsh. TheRutgers chapter was disbanded and the house doors slammed shut.   The 29 other fraternities were ordered to pull out their basementbars, which had become standard equipment at Rutgers fraternities,and make other reforms.   It could have been worse.	</TEXT><NOTE>By TONY KENNEDY</NOTE><NOTE>AP Business Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Holy cow! A one-man publishing house milkingthe Midwest for poetry and prose and not pulling for a best-seller?   Yep, and they call it just that: Holy Cow! Press.   Ask the boss, Jim Perlman, the owner, publicity agent, productiondepartment, accountant and lone editor.   ``If I really wanted to make a lot of money I'd publishcookbooks, self-help, or a lot of childrens books,'' he says.   Instead, Perlman focuses on the literary works of a select groupof writers who explore controversial issues and experiment withideas. He settled on Holy Cow! as a moniker for its shock value andbecause it reflects the Midwestern roots of his writers, most ofwhom are women or non-white.   ``I like risk-taking,'' says Perlman, who works out of his rentedhome. ``I still think that poetry is where important newground-breaking philosophies are going to come out.''   The Minneapolis native founded the press in 1977 between stintsas a student at the University of Arizona and the University ofIowa. In August he moved the business to Duluth, where his wife,Deborah Petersen-Perlman, works as a communications professor at theUniversity of Minnesota-Duluth. The couple have three children underthe age of 6.   ``He's terrific,'' says Rachel Tilsen of Hudson, Wis., a memberof Midwest Villages and Voices, a competing small press based inMinneapolis. ``He's very respectful of the writer and he has a verycreative image of the finished book and a wonderful knowledge oflanguage. He puts it together.''   Tilsen's mother, 88-year-old Meridel Le Seuer, is one of thepoets and storytellers in whom Perlman has taken an interest.Perlman delights in her activist background, including her beingblacklisted by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare.   ``I really don't want a best-seller,'' Perlman says. ``It wouldtake up a lot of time and I just don't want to be famous for onebook. I really want to do work with high literary standards.''   Perlman pores over 30 to 40 manuscripts a month but packages onlysix to eight books a year. To avoid the foreclosure that would becertain if Holy Cow! published only poetry, Perlman says he isbeginning to dabble in quality childrens books.   Reprints of Le Seuer's ``Sparrow Hawk,'' a historical tale abouta young American Indian, and ``The Story of Johnny Appleseed'' arealready on the market. Perlman plans to reprint other Le Seuer booksabout Davy Crockett, Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln's mother.   Dan Odegard, owner of Odegard Books in Minneapolis, says HolyCow! is one of about a dozen independent presses in Minnesota thatpublish books rich in literary value.   ``They fulfill a market that wouldn't be filled by largepublishers,'' Odegard says.   Reviews are important to Perlman because he rarely sees monetaryrewards. He says Lewis Hyde once wrote in The Nation magazine thatHoly Cow! was one of the best small presses in the United States.That's no small accomplishment considering the country supportsbetween 3,000 and 4,000 independent publishers, the majority ofwhich are run by one or two people.   ``A good review, to me, says it has some value, even if itdoesn't sell,'' Perlman says.   Perlman, who welcomes suggestions from his authors about thedesign of their books, says his most disappointing experience camewhen he endured an abrasive, pompous writer only to have the bookfail commercially and critically. He declined to be specific.   ``You just don't know how it's going to be received,'' Perlmansays. ``Sometimes a book just lies there acting like it's dead.''   Other times it flies. Brother Songs, a poetry anthology writtenby men about father-son, brother-brother and other malerelationships, has sold 6,000 copies since its first printing in1979 to become Holy Cow!'s most successful title.   Perlman says the book is, ``One of my answers to the feministconcerns from a male point of view.''   Other Holy Cow! books in print or nearing publication are ``StarQuilt,'' a book of poems by Roberta Hill Whiteman, an AmericanIndian studying at the University of Minnesota; ``Fun and Games,'' acollection of short fiction by black writer Clarence Major, and``The Invisible Musician,'' poems by Ray A. Young Bear, a residentof the Mesquakie tribal settlement near Tama, Iowa.   ``I found the most passion in the work of minorities,'' Perlmansays. ``I don't think that many white writers can see from the topside what's going on in the culture.''   So what makes Brother Songs and other poetry by Holy Cow! good?   Perlman says he's bullish on imagination and clarity. Subjectmatter is a close second.   And when it's all wrapped in a binding, it better be as wholesomeas fresh milk when it comes to spelling and grammar.   ``That's real important to me,'' Perlman says. ``Most of mycreative talent goes into editing.''   If a Holy Cow! book sells for $10 at bookstores, Perlman islikely to receive about $4.50 from each sale. From that he must drawhis salary, pay for production and publicity and dish out royaltyfees to the authors, who are paid cash advances in some cases.   He's usually satisfied if a poetry book sells 1,500 copies and abook of prose 3,000 to 4,000 copies, but there are no guarantees.   Because he sinks what little profit there is into the productionof more books, Perlman says he is seeking non-profit status from theInternal Revenue Service. As a non-profit enterprise, Holy Cow!would be in a better position to seek grants from tax-exemptphilanthropic organizations and give Perlman enough cash to hire astaffer and increase his volume to about 10 books a year.   ``I'm not a capitalist pig,'' Perlman says. ``But I hope withinthe next year or two I can make a regular working wage.''	</TEXT><NOTE>By The Associated Press</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House, sifting through offers, hintsand statements from the Middle East about American hostages inLebanon, says the United States wants to ``let these issues playout for a few days and see what happens.''   ``We get a lot of different statements, some optimistic, somepessimistic, some critical, some crazy,'' said White House presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater.   ``We watch them all, analyze them all and in a sense, the publicand (the press) all are seeing the process pretty much as it is.''

DALE NELSON</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For Jim Hooley, the moment of truth came as hestood on the tarmac in a remote industrial area of the Los AngelesInternational Airport, watching Ronald Reagan's eight-car caravandrive off.   ``I just suddenly realized, `It's over.' I'm standing therewaving at a car,'' he recalls.   For eight years, Hooley had been a White House advance man andthen head of the Advance Office, arranging for Reagan's presidentialtrips and accompanying him in airplanes and motorcades at home andabroad.   Now he was left at the airport.   He had known he would not travel in this final motorcade to theformer president's new home, but it still came as a shock.   ``I don't know what you expect, but it sort of ends abruptly,''he says.   Hooley's experience is typical of that of many, but not all,former White House aides as they move from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenueto more mundane addresses.   Some say they experience no pangs.   ``I had been wanting to get out of government for about fiveyears so this is a fun thing,'' says Rebecca Range, who directed theWhite House Office of Public Liaison before Jan. 20 and is now avice president of Texas Air.   ``After a while I think everyone gets to the point where theywant to live a more normal life,'' says Elizabeth Board, looking forwork after her years as director of the White House TelevisionOffice.   But for many, like Hooley, it is ``kind of traumatic.''   ``People handle it differently,'' he says. ``You went from peoplewho literally cried as they packed their cardboard boxes to otherswho went through a state of numbness.   ``I think when we began to feel it was when the time came tostart clearing out of your offices and new people who were going tobe moving into your offices were beginning to stick their heads in.''   But even after they were on the airplane headed West, Hooleysays, the impact did not quite sink in for the staff, perhaps notfor Reagan either, since the routine was one they had followedbefore.   Then came the moment at the airport.   After Hooley arrived back at his suburban Virginia home, workmencame to remove the White House telephones on every floor _ part ofthe elaborate communications setup he enjoyed as head of advance.   ``All of a sudden you realize that you are like everybody elsenow,'' he says.	</TEXT><NOTE>By W. DALE NELSON</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On a muddy hilltop in Rock Creek Park, VincentPalumbo picks his way among the mossy, broken blocks of sandstonethat once were part of the nation's Capitol.   Brush grows over the weathered pile. A fallen tree blocks hispath.   With a hammer and a chisel, Palumbo breaks off a sample from onestone, then shakes his head and turns away. He tries another, thistime marking it with a bold splash of orange dye.   This stone will now become part of the White House.   Palumbo's work this day is one step in the complicated processof restoring the stones of the presidential mansion, some of themintricately carved, to their original glory in time for the WhiteHouse bicentennial in 1992.   The $2.4 million project includes the removal of at least 39accumulated layers of paint that have been slathered onto thebuilding over almost two centuries.   The National Park Service, which maintains the White House andits grounds, awarded the contract to Stone Carving and RestorationEnterprises Inc. of Washington.   Overseeing the work as technical adviser is Palumbo, mastercarver of Washington Cathedral, the seat of the capital diocese ofthe Episcopal Church and one of the city's landmarks.   Palumbo, who came to this country from his native Italy at age26, has worked on the unfinished cathedral as a stonecarver since1961. He succeeded his father as master carver after his father'sdeath in 1966.   Several years ago, Rex Scouten, then the head usher of the WhiteHouse, asked Palumbo to repair a fireplace. Later he was asked torestore the columns of the North Portico when it was repainted in1984. The East wall of the building had been restored in 1980.   In the current project, the remaining sandstone walls are beingexposed for the first time since 1797, when the White House wasfirst painted.   In an interview in his shop at the cathedral, surrounded bygargoyles and blocks of marble, Palumbo says, ``It's a nationalthing. There is some kind of pride in being involved in restoringthe residence of the president of the great nation. Here you havethis immigrant who came over with almost nothing, and to be calledto restore the White House is a great honor.''   The restoration, officials say, is much needed.   Until 1980, the White House had been repainted about every fouryears. After a study requested by Scouten and the National ParkService in 1976, the Bureau of Standards recommended that all thepaint be chemically removed. Each section of wall is left bare forseveral months to allow the porous surface to dry. In the meantime,damaged stonework is restored.   The sandstone for the White House was quarried from Aquia Creekin northern Virginia.   The cornerstone was laid in 1792 and the walls were built anddecorated from 1794 to 1798, the work being done by 10 to 12stonecutters from Scotland.   ``The walls represented the finest stonework yet produced in theUnited States, and portions of them survive today, the onlyexamples of 18th-century craftsmanship that remain in thebuilding,'' architectural historian William Seale wrote in his 1986book, ``The President's House.''   ``It's still a good solid building,'' Palumbo says as he guidesa visitor along a scaffolding on the North wall. ``It's just thatthe surface of the stone has been corroded.''   Gary Walters, who succeeded Scouten as chief usher, agrees. TheCoast and Geodetic Survey examined the house in 1976 and attestedthat it was stable and not moving.   Removal of the paint has disclosed both beauty and damage thatwere not known to be there.   ``There are 39 layers of paint that are identifiable,'' Walterssays. ``There may have been more than that. They just took thepaintbrushes and crammed the paint in there and we'd find it 3@8 ofan inch thick in some of this stonecarving. It just hid a lot ofthis.''	</TEXT><NOTE>C.

My ``Management Improvement Program: Reform '88'' has helped makegovernment more efficient and more responsive.   We reduced waste and fraud in federal programs by combining theefforts of the inspectors general into the President's Council onIntegrity and Efficiency, resulting in over $110 billion saved orput to better use _ and their efforts are continuing.   I saw that the federal government did not have effective cashmanagement practices for dealing with what is now a $2 trillionannual cash flow, nor did it have a governmentwide credit managementprogram for what is now a $1 trillion portfolio.   This resulted in the waste of billions of dollars each year.   We built the necessary governmentwide controls in both areas andstopped the drain.   Moreover, we began the establishment of the first governmentwidefinancial accounting system, consolidating and making uniform over400 previously incompatible individual agency systems.   This was essential for any well-managed government, and ispresently being implemented.   The federal government has a major effect on our daily livesthrough the collection of taxes and fees, the direct provisions ofservices, the payment of financial assistance through variousentitlement programs, and the regulation of commercial enterprises.   Through modernization, improved administration, and automatedservices the government has made substantial reductions in the timeit takes to provide services to the public.   As the 21st century approaches, the federal government must adaptits role in our society to changing conditions and changingtechnology.   At the turn of the century, the U.S. population will exceed 268million, with a larger proportion of elderly citizens.   Changes in technology and communication will increasingly linkthe world's economies, trade, capital flows, and travel as neverbefore.	</TEXT><NOTE>Indiana</NOTE><TEXT>   District 1   Name: Visclosky, Peter J.

George Bush has asked for a review of strategic policy. Althoughneither he nor Scowcroft have spelled out the new U.S. strategy, itcould differ from Reagan's in important respects.   Scowcroft, appointed by Reagan to head a blue-ribbon panel thatstudied plans for a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile,recommended development of the single-warhead Midgetman missile,which would be based on trucks on military reservations in theSouthwest.   However, the Pentagon budget that Reagan sent to Congress on Jan.9 dropped all money for the Midgetman in favor of the 10-warhead MXmissile, which would be based on rail cars.   Scowcroft also has urged that Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program todevelop an anti-ballistic missile system be traded away in armstalks with Moscow.   And he criticized the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treatythat Reagan signed with the Soviets in December 1987. Scowcroft saidthe pact helped denuclearize Europe, a step considered beneficial tothe Kremlin because of its advantage in non-nuclear forces.   Scowcroft, 63, was born to a Mormon family in Ogden, Utah,graduated from West Point in 1947, and rose in the Air Force to therank of lieutenant general.   Scowcroft began a five-year stint at the White House as militaryaide to President Nixon in 1972-73, and was deputy to nationalsecurity adviser Henry A. Kissinger in 1973-75.

Over at the Ford truck exhibit, where the Splash was displayed,model Leah Murray said people asked frequently about the car'ssuspension and its upholstery.   ``It looks like it can go under water,'' said Murray, costumed ina wet suit. ``They always ask if it's in production and when it willbe coming out.''   Like Plymouth, Ford has not announced plans to produce the car.   The Dodge Viper R-T 10 is a concept car that has a familiar lookto sports car enthusiasts. To some, like John Koss of Rochester, ithas lines similar to the Shelby Cobra.   Unlike many concept cars, the interior of the Viper is spartan.There is no TV, no elaborate sound system or separate climatecontrols. Dials and gauges are reminiscent of roadsters 25 years old.   ``This is getting back to basics,'' said Koss, looking over thefire-engine red car with chromed exhaust pipes running along therocker panels under the doors.   Jazzy styling common to concept cars certainly isn't lost on theluxury end of the market. Displayed beside traditional Sedan DeVilles and Fleetwoods, is the Cadillac Solitare, a deep burgundynumber that got its share of attention at the show.   The classic Cadillac front end, with the well-known crest, isgone from the Solitare, something that disappointed Wally Mazer ofWestland, Mich.   ``They're going out of their class,'' he said.

The Associated Press has reportedpreviously that Inhofe apparently used campaign funds to repay a$12,000 loan in October.   The AP also reported that Inhofe told the Federal ElectionCommission in a letter dated Oct. 19, 1988, that Abercrombie lenthim $20,000 on June 30, 1986, and Inhofe then lent the money to hiscampaign.   Federal law generally forbids candidates from borrowing morethan $1,000 from individuals.   On Oct. 23, Inhofe amended his statement to the FEC and said thetransaction actually was a trade of 4,000 shares of personal stockand that he had given Abercrombie power of attorney to sell thestock.   Inhofe has denied any intentional wrongdoing, saying a candidatemay lend his own assets to his campaign and that he believed the$20,000 was his money and not a contribution from a supporter.   However, Inhofe also filed documents with the FEC that use theterms ``lender'' and ``maker'' to describe the transaction andwhich also make reference to collateral and security, an interestrate and a maturity date on the note.	</TEXT><NOTE>Oregon</NOTE><TEXT>   District 1   Name: AuCoin, Les   Party: Dem   Income: $120,250 to $124,750   Total Honoraria: $29,750   Honoraria given to charity: $2,900   Assets: $65,000 to $150,000   Liabilities: $50,000 to $100,000.
